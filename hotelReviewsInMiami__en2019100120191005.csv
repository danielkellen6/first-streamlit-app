How can you beat having fire works at the beach with a drink in your hands.","July 12, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

1,Awesome place to stay at the beach. Great hotel and accommodations. Excellent food and drinks. The location is the best location for Miami. Great places to go and shop around. The entertainment district is close by. All you need and nothing you don’t. Lovely.,"July 12, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

2,"There are few words to accurately depict Martha, who is a server at Nobu’s restaurant in Miami Beach. Every day we saw her she greeted us with a huge smile. She was genuine and worked so hard to make sure our stay was great. My mother, father and husband are still talking about how she was one of the best! I can say without hesitation that she was one of the reasons our stay at Nobu was great! I also have to commend Oswaldo, the assistant manager! He was also so focused on ensuring everyone was happy and had everything they needed. He is outstanding and it’s evident why he is a supervisor. Finally, Pierre also helped us two mornings and he too was so kind! Thanks to all three of these amazing employees for making our stay memorable!!","July 12, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

4,"Know that this is an expensive hotel. It is a nice hotel, ocean front, great staff who are ready go out of their way to take care of you but it is expensive. If you are not prepared for it the sticker shock might turn you off. Nice location","July 9, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

5,"We are very happy with our stay at Eden Roc Hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. When you are traveling with kids, especially with a 2 years old you need all the help you can get. We appreciate how this hotel did not make us feel like outsiders because of the kids. We had lunch at the pool and enjoyed our time. The prices are a bit too steep even for a New Yorker.","July 9, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

6,"We came back to Eden Roc for our 2nd visit in July 2019 with my husband and our 2 daughters (ages 3 and 8 months). We previously came in August 2018 and had a great time and this time also had my mom and father-in-law join us. I cannot speak highly enough about several of the staff of Eden Roc, who truly go above and beyond for the guests and made our vacation amazing. Raul Diaz, the reservations agent with Eden Roc who assisted us with the reservations gave us a beautiful corner suite (Room 1951) that had beautiful wrap-around views of the beach/ocean/pool area. We also had a second room (Room 2039) with beautiful pool views. Raul also had a thoughtful note and candies for the kids as a welcome gift sent to our room. The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern and have every amenity you can think of, including high end bath products, robes, and Chi hair straighteners and blow dryers, so you don't have to lug all your products from home. During our stay, the stand out staff who took care of us were Victor and Elisha at Nobu's breakfast buffet and the manager, Sam Castro. Sam took the time to listen to some of our feedback about a broken refrigerator that had spoiled my daughter's milk and had a gallon of whole milk sent to our room with a new refrigerator. He checked on us on a daily basis and really made us feel taken care of. We were able to relax and enjoy ourselves on the beach with the excellent set up every day by Juan. We also had massages at the spa that were on special discounted rates for Spa Month that were a great deal. On checkout, the bellman, Miguel, even helped me repack my over-packed suitcase and refused to take a tip after hauling our 4 heavy suitcases into the Uber. I am a very discerning (a.k.a. picky) traveler and cannot recommend Eden Roc more highly! Our family would definitely return to this great resort!","July 8, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

17,"First let me say that me and my friends come to the eden rock every year for birthday and vacation celebration the accommodations are just fabulous the staff went above and beyond the call of their duties, my birthday was the big sixty so I came to party in this wonderful, marvelous, sunny beach town. The rooms are always 10 star the house keeping staff are always their when you need them for anything, but this review is personally for the management team @ the front desk as I stated this was my big birthday celebration and the team mkucuk, Annia,Bensie & Eliazard, when we came in one night they asked me did I get my surprise and I said no, well when I got to my room their was a beautiful big piece of chocolate cake for two I was so happy, I will always come to the eden rock! this team needs a raise, promotion and any other great incentive this company offers I have been raving about this exceptional service to my friends.

18,This was my first stay at Eden Rock and I must say I will definitely be back. The vibe was great from the moment I walked in and was checked in by Nini at the front desk who gave me a 17th floor king size sweet with a beach view. I was only there for two days so I was lucky that she gave me lots of info about the endless amenities that the hotel had to offer and got checked in my room early by an hour. The staff by the pool and on the beach were very professional and helpful in getting me my food and drinks in a prompt manner. The room was very clean and had a large jacuzzi and balcony with a direct beach view from the bedside.,"July 2, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

19,"Booked a room in the Eden Roc tower, and had read in many of these review that rooms were in need of upgrade in comparison to the Nobu tower so was already coming in with a slightly skewed bias.Upon checking in, Bryan noticed it was my birthday and upgraded my room. He was pleasant and accommodating and even added two free drink tickets on top of the upgrade! Would like to add that before checking me in I noticed him handling some pain in the butt guests before me with poise and it didn't affect his demeanor dealing with me afterwards.I am in the customer service business and have had to work at antiquated facilities as well as new world class facilities. As nice as a new place can be, it is the EMPLOYEES that leave lasting memories and impressions which influence people to come back or spread a good word. By far Bryan left this impression on me and I hope that management reads this review. Please invest in this type of employee as they are hard to come by, especially in older facilities where maintenance and operational costs are high. (Personnel investments are the first budget line item to cut, I know!)-Julian","July 2, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

20,"This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. We came for my wife's birthday and stayed for 5 days. From booking to leaving it was all a great experience. The personnel made us feel so very welcomed, and treated my wife extra special for her birthday. The room was so much nicer than expected it was hard to get up and leave.The complementary continental breakfast was served at their Nobu restaurant which was nothing but superb and met by the manager Oswaldo (Ozzi) to give us a warm welcome and friendly stay.

21,This hotel was really a wonderful surprise for us. We usually stay at the Fontainbleau but due to some huge group there we decided to try the Roc and were very happy. Starting with Raoul in reservations who meticulously advised us as to which room would be perfect for us and he was right....we wanted an ocean view and he was able to get us an upgrade to a room with not only a spectacular ocean view but with a balcony as well. It made a big difference for us being able to hang out in the balcony and enjoy the sunruse. The bed was super comfy abd we both loved Malibu farm. I also need to thank Alex in concierge who gave us some additional restaurant options that were spot on. Overall the service was impressive and the hotel and weather were tops.

The servers are all very attentive, especially Priscilla, who has waited on us a few times when we've eaten there. The chef came out and introduced himself, as well.

25,"The business meeting I just managed at this property was a great success due to the amazing people at this property. They worked tirelessly and as a total team to deliver outstanding service. Our CSM Jonathan Flores headed up the team and kept things moving.Since F&B is always a major consideration on any event, the team assigned to this role play a vital part in the attendee’s experience. We were fortunate to have Captains Javier, Ahmed, Aidee and Victor and Servers Omer, Ali, Umit, Felix , Yasnier, Wilfredo, Amarilis, Jennifer, Isabella, Osmikeal, Herbert, Manny, Ciro and Mauricio. This team was so friendly and accommodating to our every wish and worked long hours every day. I also want to mention the Set-up Team of Chris, Junior and Yolando who were great at making last minute changes and modifications so the meeting rooms were exactly as requested. Finally, the onsite PSAV Team consisting of Luigi Casseus and Marion went above and beyond even helping to put up posters in the meeting space since we were in a time crunch.Thank you everybody for going above and beyond.

29,"Arrived and was greeted by the friendly staff. Because we have a 6-month-old baby the hotel wanted to move our room. This is understandable due to other guest not wanting a crying baby next door, but we were offered a room upgrade to which didn't impact our view of the sea. This helped enormously and we accepted the offer. They provided a cot for the baby which was clean and mobile on wheels. After being shown to our room, we settled into a short 4 day stay. Immediately we headed to the pool area, which is modern, lovely and clean. Went to the beach for a dip but was told that the extra fee we paid for use of the pool area doesn't stretch to the beach area and we would have to purchase the deckchairs. After speaking to the beach manager Nate, a slim black guy who was very accommodating, he managed to waver the fee and set up some chairs and an umbrella to shield our son from the sun. He was polite and sincere for the misinformation given to us by reception, and I wanted to say a big thank you for his professionalism. Every day we came to the beach he looked after us and that's the kind of service you expect from a hotel like Eden Roc. So, well done Nate, Eden Roc should look after this young man because good staff are hard to come by!","June 24, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

30,"I am a local who has moved up North so every chance I get I come back to Miami to get back in the beautiful weather, warm ocean and friendly local flavor. I have been coming to Eden Roc for 5 years now and I am always so impressed with the service and the over all experience. Its all in the details and the people! Our flight. came in very early so I called ahead and spoke to Audrey R. who said that they were fully booked the night before so she was not sure they could check me in early but they would do Pre-Check in, hold our bags and let us enjoy the pool and beach while we waited. When we finally arrived and checked in on Sunday during a very busy check out, Shenika was lovely even though she had been checking people out for the past 3 hours non stop. She was welcoming and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. We showed her our reservation and even though they were swamped we asked if she thought we might get an ocean view and be able to check in early, she did not have to but she had the room available so she gave it to us, 10th floor, beautiful ocean view, jacuzzi tub and early check in at noon! She was excellent and really set us up for a wonderful time. Then I called to ask for some additional hangers, towels and a mini-fridge. Audrey R. took my call and with in 15 minutes Vanelson was at our door with the goods in hand. They were all smiles, extra responsive and made us feel like VIP's it was a wonderful experience and we are so grateful. Eden Roc has my loyalty and with service like this they will keep it.","June 23, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

34,Stayed at the Roc over the weekend and we had an awesome time. I need to especially thank Raul in reservations who actually met us on arrival to make sure we were all set - we had an incredible ocean front suite and were blown away by the view! Just awesome!!! He made sure we were taken care of and even made our reservations for us at Malibu which was really really good. The food was terrific and the view was just special...cannot thank him enough for the little extras he did for us.. made the whole thing seamless which I was grateful for. Definitely recommend the one bedroom suite in the ocean tower with its incredible view....and the balcony was a nice added touch after laying out at the pools all day.

36,"Came here for my birthday girls trip and all of us agreed we wish we would've went elsewhere just getting the 1 night's refund 10 days later..... We rented a room there a few weeks ago based on an amazing review I saw on TripAdvisor and the guests claimed they went over and beyond for her special day. That wasn't the case for us AT ALL.1st lets just point out we had no clue its $200/night deposit nobody told us that when we made the reservation on the phone....just now getting the refund 10 days laterWe were promised a great room with an amazing view for my birthday trip coming down to Miami for the first time and it was so lackluster I couldn't believe it. The first room was so bad even the bellman stated that it wasn't renovated and he agreed it wasn't a good fit. We were thankfully moved to a 1st floor room....with absolutely no view. Oh it also had horrible AC that never worked and ants all over the bathroom sink. We were never offered the welcome cocktail as per the website, never given the gate code to reenter the hotel after visiting the beach (which is full of seaweed on the sand that's never cleared off)...the resort wasn't what I anticipated and what was sold to us online. The icing on the cake is when the valet scuffed our rental and tried to blame us.The manager did refund us one night but honestly after paying about $1000 for the few uncomfortable nights there i really want a full refund, but they refused do you know how uncomfortable it is to have a 78 degree hotel room with 3 other ladies? Instead of a 2 bd jr suite (that's supposed to have a couch) we were given 2 roll away beds...like that of holiday inn or something.Pro-given a bottle of champagne and a piece of cake which was a nice touch.Con- Valet takes forever, if you call the ticket number nobody answers spent at least 30mins every time to get the car everyday minimum. Musty Smelling hallwaysFaulty AC, outlets that didn't work, colony of ants, HORRIBLE VIEW OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND THE LOADING DOCK OF THE NEIGHBORING HOTEL, dirty outside tub (unusable) and the customer service is at a zero.I wish we would've went somewhere else to celebrate my birthday it honestly wasn't happy.","June 17, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

37,We booked two rooms a suite and two double beds. Room layouts were nice although bathrooms were not that clean. Carpets in both rooms were damp - they had either been recently cleaned or there was leakage problems from the rain which was evident in other areas of the hotel where they had absorbent socks to soak up the water. We paid for a full breakfast and were disappointed to find lattes were extra and even a restaurant manager took time out or come and tell us they would be an extra charge in quite a negative way. Valet is $50 a night and took 20 mins to retrieve our car each time as they were overstretched. We had a window of 2 hours where there was no rain in a 48 hour stay and we went to then pool to find no pool attendants or towels provided despite 30 people swimming and taking advantage of the break in the weather. Was disappointing for the price paid and we checked out a day early and moved to a better hotel for less money in Biscayne Bay. I think this resort has had its day.,"June 17, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

39,First time in Miami. Wanted to try nobu because of their reputation. Loved the hotel. A bit confused about having two hotels in one so we decided to write reviews to both. . Pretty friendly people although many friends warned us about the service in Miami. Maybe it is just this hotel that does something right. Tried nobu restaurant. It was excellent as expected. Kudos to these guys. We also tried some restaurants in the city. Timeout market was our favorite spot. Wish the weather was a little nicer but hey you can't have it all.,"June 16, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

40,"I believe this resort has a kids program for those under age 12. Our kids are 13 and 15. No game rooms, nothing of interest for teens. Pool closes at sunset, apparently because the adults get drunk and unruly so they close the pool each evening. My kids were headed for an after dinner swim when we found out they couldn’t. The beach has a huge, thick row of seaweed/kelp running the full length of the water line that the city doesn’t remove. Ocean water full of huge quantities of seaweed/kelp too so not many people in the water. So no pool, no game room, yucky ocean water. Kids are bored and unhappy. Lobby is beautiful but adult oriented. Rooms are spacious and nice but huge bathroom double sink means no counter space at all (in 2 queen beds rooms anyway). Toiletries must go on bedroom dresser instead. This hotel is mainly for adults who want to drink all day in the lobby/pool. You must leave the hotel to find family fun. Look for a family oriented resort if you are bringing kids. Huge disappointment for us.","June 16, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

41,"We went on a cruise and decided to extend our stay and enjoy Miami Beach. We wanted to stay in a place with the Miami Beach glamour that we have heard so much about. We definitely chose the right place. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the historic and beautiful lobby area. Check in was easy and we went straight to the lobby bar. The first drinks on property were just what we needed to settle in. Even though they were ""landscaping"" around the lower pool that was a bit loud, the pool team came by with free samples of wine for us to taste. Amanda by the pool was an awesome server. She was in a great mood the entire time she served us. Kudos to her! We had never been to a Nobu restaurant before and it didn't disappoint. The breakfast buffet was excellent and way better then what we had expected. Dinner was 5 star experience. A bit pricey but the service and most importantly the food is out of this world.

48,"First on a positive note, the room i had was top notch, i mean i was blown away. Now with that said, the first day, the room service was great, then from tues-thursday, the level of service went downhill. We only got 1 washcloth per day, we asked and complained about that, we went out and bought our own, now mind you, we have a suite. the cleanliness was horrible, how you clean the room and not the complete bathroom? With all these issues, they let us check out late & a $200 credit. the next shock was the fact there was a fridge and microwave in the room. We didn't get that during our stay. We was told to ask for that if we wanted it. Really? with the price of the room, why we wasn't given the option for it? we could have saved money, we could have used that money saved for other activities out there.

50,"Eden Roc is situated away from the hustle of central South Beach where you cross the boardwalk to get to the beach. It is a bit pricey but worth it if you get a deal. The hotel is clan, nice pools and great service. The breakfast at the Nobu was expensive but great mix and well done display with a variety of choices. You only get 2 Beach chairs per room and you have to pay for extra and the umbrellas which I thought was extreme as you are paying $35 per day resort fees. The extra chairs $19 and the umbrella $32 just a bit too much. I did enjoy my stay and love the staff but bottle water was complimentary for your room it felt like you had to beg for them to put water in your room. That was my only complaint!!

54,"While the facilities and perks of staying at this hotel are awesome, the actual room was quite underwhelming. The property as a whole is stunning. The atmosphere in the lobby is awesome and is beautiful. Easy access to beach, gorgeous and fun pool area. So many restaurants to choose from and so much to do right in the hotel. However our room was very small. The worst part was how small the bathroom was. I could barely move in there. It felt like the kind of bathroom you get in a cabin on a cruise ship. When I booked a ""deluxe king ocean view room"" and paid the amount of money I did, I was expecting something very different than what I walked into. I was stunned at how plain and small the room was. It didn't feel like I was staying at a luxury hotel at all. Especially not one of the caliber that the Fontainbleu is. I don't think it was worth the amount of money I paid. I will definitely return to this hotel but only when I can afford an oceanfront room in the Sorrento tower.I guess you have to pay even more to get a decent room at this hotel.","July 12, 2019","1    Fontainebleau

When we walked into our room we couldn’t have been happier with it. Our room in the Tresser Tower was stunning and had the most amazing view of both the ocean and Miami Beach! (Picture from morning) My only small complaint would be with some of the service staff. We hung out at the pool every day Monday- Wednesday and decided to rent a cabana bed on Tuesday to get the full experience. The service staff on Monday while just sitting at the chairs was ok. The pool staff that helped get our chair and umbrella set up was nice. The waitresses we had that day just did not seem to care about us at all. They were just there to get their automatic 18% and take our order. Most times I had to go find our sever. The pool BAR staff that was there on Monday and Tuesday were amazing. I went up there to get our drinks after not getting great service at the chairs. I wrote down the one bartenders name but unfortunately lost it. They were friendly and nice and I made sure to get at least a drink or two from them Tuesday because of the experience I had Monday! The service at our cabana bed on Tuesday was great- our server was very nice and took care of us and I cannot say enough about English. English was one of if not the nicest staff member we meet the whole trip! He made sure my wife and I were comfortable and had everything we needed. On Wednesday we only came down to the pool towards the end of the day since we only wanted a quick drink and I just went to the bar. The Wednesday’s bar staff left a bad taste in my mouth. Again, I could tell that all three guys behind the bar were just making drinks for their 18%. No hello or thank you just what do you want and here you go tax and service are included.

Stripsteak was also delicious and that 70 oz tomahawk steak was great and perfectly cooked. Thank you Eladie for providing great service! Hakkasan was also fantastic - we had the Peking duck- loved it!All of the pool staff was a lot of fun and very accommodating with all of our requests. Having a cabana was very helpful- as it was hot those day. On our last day, we had Svetlana and she was amazing! She went above and beyond and always had a smile and was super friendly.

All guest requests were met with pleasure. We tried desperately to get reservations at the Hakkasan restaurant and only with our server Svetlana were we able to get in. Besides that, she spoiled us rotten, has the best attitude and hustles like a marathon runner. What an Ambassador!

101,"This is a lovely hotel but the pools cannot accommodate the number of guests. When you book definitely have clarified the room you are getting. We were told bay view with a balcony and you opened the curtains and saw the top of a roof. Barely any view especially if sitting on the balcony. Also, no coffee maker in certain rooms. Come on, even two star hotels provide coffee makers in the room. The rooms were basic and nothing elaborate but I am assuming we did not have an upscale room but I still paid over $500 a night. I would dine here again but not stay here. There are many other hotels in Miami Beach that offer better luxuries for a better price.","June 30, 2019","1    Fontainebleau

You have to pay for everything. We’ve heard an outside noise all night couldn’t sleep well. The air conditioning made me and my husband had a headache.. too cold too dry I don’t know what was wrong. The beds sound when you sit at them... pillows just are so uncomfortable. PoolClean but Too crowdy... you can not access all of them. Too noisy. Staff redirects you...

109,"A beautiful property, view and room. This is standard for hotels in the area, but what truly makes a stay memorable is the service. Thanks to Bryan, the front desk agent who checked us in, our stay truly noteworthy. When checking in, he immediately greeted us with a genuine warm smile and demeanor. He inquired on details of our visit, which we shared it was our first night away from our first and only baby, as well as my birthday. Although locals to FL, we were enjoying a night in Miami and dinner at Nobu and it was a special treat. Bryan ensured we had a nice room and even offered breakfast. He shared information about the property and thanked us for staying there. From that moment on, we enjoyed an incredible stay, beautiful view in a more intimate hotel. Some hotels feel so corporate, yet eden roc was very unique and warm yet chic. Nobu was FANTASTIC for both dinner and breakfast, which was served at the same restaurant. We’ve stayed at the W, the ritz and Fountainbleu in Miami and have high expectations in hospitality overall. Eden Roc is a gem. We appreciate excellent service, food, CLEANLINESS (I’m a germaphobe!) and ambiance and this hotel met my expectation. Most of all, we appreciated Bryan for his fantastic service and setting the tone for our stay.

118,"We came back to Eden Roc for our 2nd visit in July 2019 with my husband and our 2 daughters (ages 3 and 8 months). We previously came in August 2018 and had a great time and this time also had my mom and father-in-law join us. I cannot speak highly enough about several of the staff of Eden Roc, who truly go above and beyond for the guests and made our vacation amazing. Raul Diaz, the reservations agent with Eden Roc who assisted us with the reservations gave us a beautiful corner suite (Room 1951) that had beautiful wrap-around views of the beach/ocean/pool area. We also had a second room (Room 2039) with beautiful pool views. Raul also had a thoughtful note and candies for the kids as a welcome gift sent to our room. The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern and have every amenity you can think of, including high end bath products, robes, and Chi hair straighteners and blow dryers, so you don't have to lug all your products from home. During our stay, the stand out staff who took care of us were Victor and Elisha at Nobu's breakfast buffet and the manager, Sam Castro. Sam took the time to listen to some of our feedback about a broken refrigerator that had spoiled my daughter's milk and had a gallon of whole milk sent to our room with a new refrigerator. He checked on us on a daily basis and really made us feel taken care of. We were able to relax and enjoy ourselves on the beach with the excellent set up every day by Juan. We also had massages at the spa that were on special discounted rates for Spa Month that were a great deal. On checkout, the bellman, Miguel, even helped me repack my over-packed suitcase and refused to take a tip after hauling our 4 heavy suitcases into the Uber. I am a very discerning (a.k.a. picky) traveler and cannot recommend Eden Roc more highly! Our family would definitely return to this great resort!","July 8, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

We were able to get into our room early right upon arrival and were pleased to also have a $75 resort credit and free daily continental breakfast. Loved the Lobby Bar, specialty cocktails, MalibuFarm, the fitness facilities, and our spacious room with gorgeous ocean view. Only complaints--the pool area is not large enough to serve all the guests comfortably. Too many people. Also, would be nice if one of the pools were an adults only pool. Also, for a hotel of this class, beach chairs should be included in the resort fee price. Make sure to check your bill carefully at checkout as they forgot to give us the $75 resort credit and charged us for one of our complimentary breakfasts.

126,"We stayed at Eden Roc for a day. The stay could not been great of Benji was not there. She is absolutely incredible in terms of guest experience. She helped us getting the best room. We had a minor issues at checkin for which we saw there there is a bottle of wine waiting for us in the room! Felt absolutely at home and again Benji is the best!!! Keep rocking. In the evening live entertainment was great! For car lovers - first time I spotted the swanky cars at one place like Lamborghini’s , Rolls etc Just for the hotel folks on the beach - they could learn few of these skills from Benji how guest should be treated especially when the guest is new for the property. Benji thanks again and hope you see you soon!!","July 7, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

The vibe was great from the moment I walked in and was checked in by Nini at the front desk who gave me a 17th floor king size sweet with a beach view. I was only there for two days so I was lucky that she gave me lots of info about the endless amenities that the hotel had to offer and got checked in my room early by an hour.

139,Stayed here with my mum last month. Check in was quick and the staff friendly. Our ocean front suite was stunning. We were 21st (top) floor and it was incredible. Floor to ceiling views of turquoise water fill the living room and bedroom. We loved our room as it had a separate living room with dining area and a large bathroom. The coffee shop downstairs was very expensive though and the pool area fairly full especially on weekends.

140,"Booked a room in the Eden Roc tower, and had read in many of these review that rooms were in need of upgrade in comparison to the Nobu tower so was already coming in with a slightly skewed bias.Upon checking in, Bryan noticed it was my birthday and upgraded my room. He was pleasant and accommodating and even added two free drink tickets on top of the upgrade! Would like to add that before checking me in I noticed him handling some pain in the butt guests before me with poise and it didn't affect his demeanor dealing with me afterwards.I am in the customer service business and have had to work at antiquated facilities as well as new world class facilities. As nice as a new place can be, it is the EMPLOYEES that leave lasting memories and impressions which influence people to come back or spread a good word. By far Bryan left this impression on me and I hope that management reads this review. Please invest in this type of employee as they are hard to come by, especially in older facilities where maintenance and operational costs are high. (Personnel investments are the first budget line item to cut, I know!)-Julian","July 2, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

141,"Overall, its a very nice hotel, but has some issues that prevented me from giving this a 5 star rating. The rooms are very nice, mine directly overlooked the ocean and was a pretty good sized room. Bathroom was very nice, with a jetted tub and separate shower. bed faced the ocean which was also a change from it being sideways like in many other ocean front rooms. I did room service most nights and the food was good, but very expensive which is to be expected. Now the not so good, i was with a conference group of about 200 and the elevators in our tower were constantly having problems. At least 1 of the three was not working at any given time and the day of checkout when all 200 of us were trying to check out at the same time, 2 of the three stopped working. Watching people drag their luggage down 15+ flights of stairs was painful. I could also not get my room below 73 degrees which seemed pretty common with all of the other attendees. I thought it was because it was miami in the middle of summer, but them i transferred to another hotel for the weekend and there were no issues keeping the room cooler so something was not right with their HVAC.Overall, nice hotel, but i think there are better options in the area with less issues.","July 2, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

143,This hotel was really a wonderful surprise for us. We usually stay at the Fontainbleau but due to some huge group there we decided to try the Roc and were very happy. Starting with Raoul in reservations who meticulously advised us as to which room would be perfect for us and he was right....we wanted an ocean view and he was able to get us an upgrade to a room with not only a spectacular ocean view but with a balcony as well. It made a big difference for us being able to hang out in the balcony and enjoy the sunruse. The bed was super comfy abd we both loved Malibu farm. I also need to thank Alex in concierge who gave us some additional restaurant options that were spot on. Overall the service was impressive and the hotel and weather were tops.

144,"A lovely hotel, we had a rocky start with our booking not being on file and the staff at the desk needing extra assistance. Sam was able to sort us out and we received an upgraded room for the hassle. Room was lovely, level 19 ocean view. Recommend highly, bed is very comfortable.We did however extend our booking by one night which was a debacle for check in and out as we had to go back down to reception to check out and in again. For both bookings we were charged twice for the accommodation, along with items we didn't use in the mini bar before being asked. We also had to ask for the $25 per day credit to be applied and needed to wait for 7 days for the refunds despite the charges being taken out straight away.Malibu Farm is also expensive for cocktails by the pool, it is good food and drinks bit like everything in Miami very expensive, keep an eye on your tab as they can often add in additional items by mistake.","June 30, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

Shakia reached out to us with our travel agent on the phone and offered us a paid upgrade, but the fee was a little too steep for us, but Shakia still went out of her way to make sure our anniversary was still memorable. She sent us a bottle of champagne, with strawberries and a very personal note. Everyday we called down she was so sweet and expedited all of our request. It’s now our last day here and she set us up for an Ocean view room and It is breathtaking. I have never been so catered to on such a manner. Thank you so much Shakia for everything.

157,"Arrived and was greeted by the friendly staff. Because we have a 6-month-old baby the hotel wanted to move our room. This is understandable due to other guest not wanting a crying baby next door, but we were offered a room upgrade to which didn't impact our view of the sea. This helped enormously and we accepted the offer. They provided a cot for the baby which was clean and mobile on wheels. After being shown to our room, we settled into a short 4 day stay. Immediately we headed to the pool area, which is modern, lovely and clean. Went to the beach for a dip but was told that the extra fee we paid for use of the pool area doesn't stretch to the beach area and we would have to purchase the deckchairs. After speaking to the beach manager Nate, a slim black guy who was very accommodating, he managed to waver the fee and set up some chairs and an umbrella to shield our son from the sun. He was polite and sincere for the misinformation given to us by reception, and I wanted to say a big thank you for his professionalism. Every day we came to the beach he looked after us and that's the kind of service you expect from a hotel like Eden Roc.

I have been coming to Eden Roc for 5 years now and I am always so impressed with the service and the over all experience. Its all in the details and the people! Our flight. came in very early so I called ahead and spoke to Audrey R. who said that they were fully booked the night before so she was not sure they could check me in early but they would do Pre-Check in, hold our bags and let us enjoy the pool and beach while we waited. When we finally arrived and checked in on Sunday during a very busy check out, Shenika was lovely even though she had been checking people out for the past 3 hours non stop. She was welcoming and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. We showed her our reservation and even though they were swamped we asked if she thought we might get an ocean view and be able to check in early, she did not have to but she had the room available so she gave it to us, 10th floor, beautiful ocean view, jacuzzi tub and early check in at noon! She was excellent and really set us up for a wonderful time. Then I called to ask for some additional hangers, towels and a mini-fridge. Audrey R. took my call and with in 15 minutes Vanelson was at our door with the goods in hand. They were all smiles, extra responsive and made us feel like VIP's it was a wonderful experience and we are so grateful.

162,We actually booked this hotel on HOTWIRE just wanted to get out for one night.. Got a fantastic deal. When we got there Diana from the front desk was awesome and so helpful... (usually you deal with snooty people) and it was refreshing dealing with a genuine professional.. Anyway the hotel grounds are well kept. The pool was nice and great staff... We ate at Nobu and it was nice... service was whatever (imposed tip and they know it) and our room was great.. Very beautiful we had a balcony suite on the highest floor... great view of both intercoastal and ocean. I will be back!,"June 21, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

163,"We stayed here with two of our kids in June. The week were there they happen to open their kids camp. Although, it was their first day I thought they did a nice job. The kids had fun and best of all we did not have to pay for it because we were their first customers. We dined at Malibu farms. The food was ok but we enjoyed the service. I can’t recall the name of the server, she is a medium built Latin girl who was very sweet.","June 20, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

165,Stayed at the Roc over the weekend and we had an awesome time. I need to especially thank Raul in reservations who actually met us on arrival to make sure we were all set - we had an incredible ocean front suite and were blown away by the view! Just awesome!!! He made sure we were taken care of and even made our reservations for us at Malibu which was really really good. The food was terrific and the view was just special...cannot thank him enough for the little extras he did for us.. made the whole thing seamless which I was grateful for. Definitely recommend the one bedroom suite in the ocean tower with its incredible view....and the balcony was a nice added touch after laying out at the pools all day. Thank you thank you Raul for everything you did for our little group!,"June 19, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

166,"My family and I were privileged to spend 5 days/4 nights at the Eden Roc Miami Beach hotel last week, in honor of my 40th birthday. We reserved an ocean-view junior suite. Despite the friendliness and sincere apologies from the staff, the check-in process was a bit difficult, as our room was an hour late due to housekeeping issues. That was a struggle for us as we had been traveling since early that morning and had to wait in the lobby for almost 2 hours before we could get to our room. Once we were through with that, things really improved. The Eden Roc is perfectly situated in Miami Beach, on the outskirts of the action, in a serene and luxurious part of the strip. Yet, you are within minutes (walking or driving) of all the attractions, dining, shopping, etc. The property is decorated in a sophisticated style, impeccably maintained, and surrounded by beautiful pools and lush vegetation. The beach is a stones throw away from the hotel's back door, across the boardwalk. We didn't utilize it much due to rain and heavy seaweed. Our suite was also lovely- bamboo, light wood, marble counters and high thread count cottons. Beds were comfortable, WiFi and cable were reliable, bathroom had a rain shower (magical) and jetted tub, amenities were from Maison Margiela, an absolutely delicious aroma with notes of wood, spice, bergamot and tobacco, that is sprayed around the whole property. A big plus In room was the Nespresso machine and generously stocked minibar- which we did not use. We dined on the premises only once, Nobu Miami for brunch- gorgeous setting/ambiance and creative food offerings. In general, we did observe that the locally sourced options available cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions. Two staff members we'd especially like to thank- CARLOS Z. the doorman, who made our stay a total delight. He assisted us with our luggage, parking needs, umbrellas, waters, so many things.. He is the quintessential ""above and beyond"" employee who does his job with a genuine smile, integrity and caring. We will never forget him. And AMANDA, a waitress by the pools, who was paying attention and observed a moment when I needed help but didn't want to ask for it and then also went above and beyond to take care of my specific need. I would give the hotel five stars but the check in experience, as well as a contact I made to the hotel prior to check-in, were disappointing, therefore 4.5 stars. Otherwise Eden Roc, it was an awesome stay! Would definitely return. THANK YOU! - Orlene, Shaun & Maia","June 18, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

168,"Came here for my birthday girls trip and all of us agreed we wish we would've went elsewhere just getting the 1 night's refund 10 days later..... We rented a room there a few weeks ago based on an amazing review I saw on TripAdvisor and the guests claimed they went over and beyond for her special day. That wasn't the case for us AT ALL.1st lets just point out we had no clue its $200/night deposit nobody told us that when we made the reservation on the phone....just now getting the refund 10 days laterWe were promised a great room with an amazing view for my birthday trip coming down to Miami for the first time and it was so lackluster I couldn't believe it. The first room was so bad even the bellman stated that it wasn't renovated and he agreed it wasn't a good fit. We were thankfully moved to a 1st floor room....with absolutely no view. Oh it also had horrible AC that never worked and ants all over the bathroom sink. We were never offered the welcome cocktail as per the website, never given the gate code to reenter the hotel after visiting the beach (which is full of seaweed on the sand that's never cleared off)...the resort wasn't what I anticipated and what was sold to us online. The icing on the cake is when the valet scuffed our rental and tried to blame us.The manager did refund us one night but honestly after paying about $1000 for the few uncomfortable nights there i really want a full refund, but they refused do you know how uncomfortable it is to have a 78 degree hotel room with 3 other ladies? Instead of a 2 bd jr suite (that's supposed to have a couch) we were given 2 roll away beds...like that of holiday inn or something.Pro-given a bottle of champagne and a piece of cake which was a nice touch.Con- Valet takes forever, if you call the ticket number nobody answers spent at least 30mins every time to get the car everyday minimum. Musty Smelling hallwaysFaulty AC, outlets that didn't work, colony of ants, HORRIBLE VIEW OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND THE LOADING DOCK OF THE NEIGHBORING HOTEL, dirty outside tub (unusable) and the customer service is at a zero.I wish we would've went somewhere else to celebrate my birthday it honestly wasn't happy.","June 17, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

169,Came here for a bachelorette and we were immediately greeted with friendly smiles by Carlos Z. And other staff. Carlos and staff were so helpful in making sure our bags were brought up and even provided us with a complimentary bottle in honor of the bride to be. The hotel is very clean modern and chic. Right next door to fountainbleu. I like the location as it was a little further for the hustle and bustle of south beach. Room service was great. Pool side service also great. The only thing we had a problem was with our $75 credit which we were told we can use for room service but in fact not true. The manger quickly fixed the problem. I just wish there was better communication initially. I would definitely stay again.,"June 17, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

170,We booked two rooms a suite and two double beds. Room layouts were nice although bathrooms were not that clean. Carpets in both rooms were damp - they had either been recently cleaned or there was leakage problems from the rain which was evident in other areas of the hotel where they had absorbent socks to soak up the water. We paid for a full breakfast and were disappointed to find lattes were extra and even a restaurant manager took time out or come and tell us they would be an extra charge in quite a negative way. Valet is $50 a night and took 20 mins to retrieve our car each time as they were overstretched. We had a window of 2 hours where there was no rain in a 48 hour stay and we went to then pool to find no pool attendants or towels provided despite 30 people swimming and taking advantage of the break in the weather. Was disappointing for the price paid and we checked out a day early and moved to a better hotel for less money in Biscayne Bay. I think this resort has had its day.,"June 17, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

Pretty friendly people although many friends warned us about the service in Miami. Maybe it is just this hotel that does something right. Tried nobu restaurant. It was excellent as expected. Kudos to these guys. We also tried some restaurants in the city. Timeout market was our favorite spot.

175,"I believe this resort has a kids program for those under age 12. Our kids are 13 and 15. No game rooms, nothing of interest for teens. Pool closes at sunset, apparently because the adults get drunk and unruly so they close the pool each evening. My kids were headed for an after dinner swim when we found out they couldn’t. The beach has a huge, thick row of seaweed/kelp running the full length of the water line that the city doesn’t remove. Ocean water full of huge quantities of seaweed/kelp too so not many people in the water. So no pool, no game room, yucky ocean water. Kids are bored and unhappy. Lobby is beautiful but adult oriented. Rooms are spacious and nice but huge bathroom double sink means no counter space at all (in 2 queen beds rooms anyway). Toiletries must go on bedroom dresser instead. This hotel is mainly for adults who want to drink all day in the lobby/pool. You must leave the hotel to find family fun. Look for a family oriented resort if you are bringing kids. Huge disappointment for us.","June 16, 2019","0    Eden Roc Miami Beach Resort

We definitely chose the right place. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the historic and beautiful lobby area. Check in was easy and we went straight to the lobby bar. The first drinks on property were just what we needed to settle in. Even though they were ""landscaping"" around the lower pool that was a bit loud, the pool team came by with free samples of wine for us to taste. Amanda by the pool was an awesome server. She was in a great mood the entire time she served us. Kudos to her! We had never been to a Nobu restaurant before and it didn't disappoint.

Now with that said, the first day, the room service was great, then from tues-thursday, the level of service went downhill. We only got 1 washcloth per day, we asked and complained about that, we went out and bought our own, now mind you, we have a suite. the cleanliness was horrible, how you clean the room and not the complete bathroom? With all these issues, they let us check out late & a $200 credit. the next shock was the fact there was a fridge and microwave in the room. We didn't get that during our stay. We was told to ask for that if we wanted it. Really? with the price of the room, why we wasn't given the option for it? we could have saved money, we could have used that money saved for other activities out there.

189,"I would honestly give this place a negative rating if I could. The only reason why I stayed here in the first place was to have dinner at Nobu and I figured Nobu wouldn't be associated with such a horrible establishment. First of all, when I checked in, the lady at the front desk was very rude and she had no idea what she was talking about! Not to mention, she was chewing her gum as she was speaking to me (so unprofessional). I booked a Florida resident rate that included a daily complimentary valet. However, before even checking my reservation, she said no I have to pay, it's $48 plus tax. We went back and forth for a couple of minutes, then she finally reviewed my reservation and said, ""yes, you are correct."" Secondly, the carpet near the gold elevators was dirty and disgusting to even walk on. The hallway to our room stunk like a wet dog. My room had no fridge ($35 fee if you wanted to request one) the lamp shades in my room was cracked and falling apart. The only nice thing in my room was the bathroom, the shower and sink were surprisingly beautiful. I ordered room service and my shrimp was raw, they took the item off my bill, but how do you botch cooking shrimp??? Totally ridiculous!!! This is one of the worst places to stay in Miami Beach, please don't be fooled like me when reading these great reviews, etc., The website is deceiving with their wonderful looking pics.

192,"Eden Roc is situated away from the hustle of central South Beach where you cross the boardwalk to get to the beach. It is a bit pricey but worth it if you get a deal. The hotel is clan, nice pools and great service. The breakfast at the Nobu was expensive but great mix and well done display with a variety of choices. You only get 2 Beach chairs per room and you have to pay for extra and the umbrellas which I thought was extreme as you are paying $35 per day resort fees. The extra chairs $19 and the umbrella $32 just a bit too much. I did enjoy my stay and love the staff but bottle water was complimentary for your room it felt like you had to beg for them to put water in your room. That was my only complaint!!

When me and my family first arrived the bell hop was very aggressive and kept telling us to write a positive review mind you we haven’t even unpacked or bags yet. He stayed in our room asking us to please leave a review because it would help him get a raise.

There are two pools, plenty of lounges and a wonderful pool/beach bar. The beach is also super close and the service on the beach could not have been better. EXTRA POINTS for the vats of Sun Bum sunscreen all over the pool and beach area! Much appreciated!

The sign said that one would be shut down until 9:00 am, but it we could hear it and woke us up at 6:00 or 7:00.The biggest negative was the weekend DJ at the pool, playing Loud, Noisy rap music.

My friend and I checked into the hotel early and was accommodated right away. They found a clean room for us, upgraded our room as well after realizing that I was celebrating a birthday an also a Marriott employee. The front desk manager, Nathia I believe, was amazing in getting all accommodations together. Before we even got to the hotel one of our front desk supervisors set up with an employee at the hotel to have a suprise set up in my room for my birthday. I would like to say thank you Tyehimba for making my birthday so special!! One last compliment goes to the wonder bartender, Victor, at the pool bar! He is full of energy makes sure you are well taken care of and gives good recommendations on things to try on the menu. Overall a great hotel with great staff.

259,"Pros: beautiful, updated decor, upscale in room espresso maker, direct beach access, soft towels (rare for hotels), luxurious bathroom amenities by l’occitaine, beach games, adult pool is a nice option for a quieter environment, good happy hour deals Monday to Thursday at the beach/poolside restaurant, comfy loungers, mini fridge provided at no charge upon request, rooms with two queen beds not just doubles, free wifi was reliable and a good speed Cons: we are a family of four (this includes two teenagers) but only 2 beach chairs are included with the room so really our daily rate was an extra $34. I wish they would just work that into the rate so I don’t have to feel nickel and dimed every day. It felt like the hotel was being stingy. We are four paying guests after all. When I booked I was told that we would get 4 chairs but I could tell the lady wasn’t really sure. The $22/day for the beach umbrella is disappointing. We stayed in July and you absolutely could not be without it. I figure summer is probably low season so I would think you could throw in the umbrella. Again, just throw it on to my room rate then I feel I’m getting it at no charge and if I don’t use it, you have the money anyway. We never had trouble getting chairs at the beach but if you are a pool person, get up early. There are not a lot of pool chairs available, especially in comparison to how many guests can be at the hotel at one time. This is especially bad at the adult pool. There are only 50 chairs there. That’s not a lot for a hotel of this size in a city that is really geared toward adults. There was a waiting list for pool chairs each day we were there but no real system for making sure guests inform attendants they are done.Just so you know: $10 to $12 each way for an uber to downtown Miami or south beach. We walked back from south beach one night. It took 45 minutes and actually would have been a nice stroll except it was scorching hot, even at night, so it was a bad decision ","July 5, 2019","4    Cadillac Hotel & Beach Club, Autograph Collection

264,"After making a same-day/last-minute reservation, I was very grateful to the front office staff (in particular, Trenece) for locating a room based on my preferences. Excellent guest relations at the beginning. While getting settled in the room, I started to notice what began as a few housekeeping misses that grew and left me feeling unclean. I requested the room undergo a deep clean. The housekeeping manager that came to the room was very dismissive of my concerns and believed the room passed a normal standard. I disagreed as I believe the hotel should certainly hold itself higher than previous guest hair on the floor, shower and stuck to the bath towels (following laundering process), as well as stains on the bed linens. I have expressed my concerns directly to the GM who could not have been more apologetic and sincere. Jury is still out for me on whether I’d return or recommend Cadillac Hotel.

The rooms were also great, beds were pretty uncomfortable.One BIG downside was the upcharges this hotel threw on EVERYTHING. We ordered room service= $5 service charge, and the delivery person expected tip. BUFFET breakfast = +$5 service charge (for what???), Ordered a pina colada at the pool = +$5 service charge again!!We ordered food from the bar outside and picked it up ourselves (2 burgers + 1 pizza = $80!!!!!!) INSANE charges for service and food from this place!!!AND not to mention the $30 resort fee...shouldn't all of this be covered?The front desk staff were blah and not that great, didn't want to listen to anything.

Everybody was super helpful Patrick as the manager, Esteban as front concierge, girls at the front desk, Francesca at the pool service. All of you were outstanding! Thank you! You all made me feel so welcomed . The cleaning people were excellent and on point. Is very rare a hotel will come and check on you to see if you need anything. The front Bellman, I forget his name even him excellent service very helpful always there to take the initiative and do it respectfully. Room service though Limited was professional and quick to deliver. I can't really say enough great things about the service, which if you know as being in Miami Beach excellent service is very hard to come by. People hear a trained properly and you could see the amount of time that goes into the training.Location was great for me as I like to stay a little bit more North it's just a little bit slower and a better class of people not as rowdy or vagrants .I had a double bedroom which was very roomy with a beautiful view of the pool and the ocean. Another huge Plus getting a spacious Room in Miami Beach!All this in a very reasonable rate. Of which Esteban was nice enough to offer a few free breakfasts.I highly recommend the hotel and we'll definitely be staying here again as everything was on point severally enjoy this day.

The room was really good.The only issue we faced was at the time of checking in. It almost took us 45 mins. We had booked the room using points. Instead of swiping my card for the hold fee, the reception decided to swipe extra 300 bucks without even informing me before as she was under the impression that we had got the room at a discounted rate. This chaos lasted for good 30 mins which involved me calling my credit card company in India asking them to reverse the charge.

The balcony had a lovely breeze and views. The room was up to date, clean, comfortable and spacious for south beach standards. My second room was on floor 5, facing the pool. My balcony had a lovely pool and ocean view (pictured). Despite the proximity to the pool, the room as still quiet and again, clean, comfortable and spacious. The staff at the Cadillac was very impressive. Always someone grabbing my front door, friendly bell men happy to help with luggage or information and a front desk staff that actually cared and strived to fulfill my needs. Thanks for the tape!

Really like the big dispenser of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel they have in the shower. All the staff are always so accomondating. They are all about their guests having a wonderful stay. They are always making sure you have everything you need or want. Oscar always remembers your name and being sure you didn't need something. Also great experience on the beach. The staff at the Bungalow by the sea, checking to see if you need anything to eat or drink. They put the towel cover on the lounger for you and bring you towels. Highly recommend this place to stay for a very pleasurable vacation. My grandaughter and I had a fantastic vacation here.

282,"The moment we arrived to The Cadillac, Oscar S was super attentive and extremely welcoming. We arrived super early and were unable to check in but he offered to grab our stuff so we could hang outside and relax until the room was ready. He even surprised my friend with chocolate covered fruits as we were celebrating her birthday (appreciated immensely). He always checked up on us during our entire stay and helped us with anything that we needed. He is one of the best staff members that I came across during our stay at The Cadillac. Oscars charisma makes me look forward to staying at The Cadillac when I visit Miami and I will definitely recommend this hotel to all of my friends and give a shout out to Oscar, as he took care of my friends and I during the entire stay!","June 21, 2019","4    Cadillac Hotel & Beach Club, Autograph Collection

Akeem went above and beyond with exceptional customer service, making our one night stay a memory to remember. Akeem upgraded us to a top floor oven view. So beautiful.

Everyone from the front desk, the pool, the bar, to the beach was amazing. They headed over to me anytime they believed I needed any sort of assistance. Not to mention the cleaners and how much effort they put in, every morning everything looked so spotless. The pool manager (Maggie I believe her name is) was so kind and such a sweet heart, she always greeted me with a smile and was always making sure that I was enjoying myself.

288,"Because Ive been a Platinum SPG member for the past 7 years I have always patronized the W brand when visiting South Beach because the customer service, location, decor and amenities are exceptional bar none. However with the Marriott merger and new Bonvoy program I decided to give the other portfolio of hotels a go. Well what do you know... Surprise surprise...While I would never say a negative word about the W because they have treated me like royalty ..the price point and service you get at the Cadillac including the decor is hard to compare and argue with. The value you pay for what you recieve you are WINNING!! the breakfast is by far the best deal if you have a choice between points. The rooms are well appointed and while not large their suites if upgraded or pay for the upgrade are more than enough space for an extended stay or company. Patrick a desk manager speaks customer service and so does the pleasantly always welcomes you with a smile Haley at check in. The kinks in the bar service when ordering food still needs work and the menu needs more variety. the beach chairs are cushioned and comfortable. The bungalow bar is fun!! ALl in ALL a great stay. If you get a city view ask for a room ending in 21 and if you get an ocean ask for a 45.. Oh yeah no turn down service and because of the price point it is a very inclusive diverse crowd..not so much stuck up ritz South Beach Miami goers!!!","June 18, 2019","4    Cadillac Hotel & Beach Club, Autograph Collection

290,"We got an ocean view room on the 8th floor. The hotel is posh and clean overall. The staff and services are great. All the staff who works there are friendly and they really care about you having an enjoyable stay. Even though they are not a 5 star hotel, they have thought of details like having sun tan lotions and water by the pool so all hotel guests have to bring is their own swim suits. My only dissatisfaction is with all the extra fees like resort fees and 20% auto tip for even 2 people. These fees make the states resorts less competitive than many other resorts countries like Mexico, Cuba and Bahamas. Our average rooms fees are more than a 5 star hotel in Dubai...which is quite telling. Overall, I would still recommend this hotel to my friends and family.","June 16, 2019","4    Cadillac Hotel & Beach Club, Autograph Collection

The hotel has full service amenities including two pools with lounge chairs and food and beverage service, an outdoor bar and restaurant and beachfront access with chair and umbrella set up (chairs come with the room and an umbrella is a little extra cost) and bar and food service, yet the resort maintains a boutique-y vibe. We are Marriott Platinum and received an upgrade to an oceanfront suite, which was very spacious with a beautiful view of the beach and pools. The rooms are modern and airy.

Booked Oceanfront room with balcony. When we arrived what we got was a Oceanfront room with no balcony and just windows. I asked about it and was told sorry that's all we have. The hotel provides beach towels & beach lounge chairs but you have to pay additional for an umbrella. For the price of the hotel and the price of resort fees you pay, u would think the umbrella would be included.

That is the reason why I don't want to risk it and stay in some bad hotel, which would ruin the vacation for me. Loews is exactly what I need in order to have the best time in Miami: it has amazing, clean and spacious rooms with wonderful ocean views. And the balcony is big enough for you not to feel claustrophobic but to really enjoy it. The location is TOP - 3 min walk from Lincoln Rd Mall, and there are a lot of other shops and cafe places around. And if you like visiting night clubs like we do, this is also a very good location: it is in between Story an Liv.It has an amazing outdoor pool with live music, which is perfect in case that the ocean is a wavy and dirty. And the food is not so bad either - I like Nicoise salad and nachos the most. :) Included in the room cost you also get beach chairs and towels, which is great, because you don't have to carry your own towel or pay for it. And the beach is right after you pass the pool.

The front desk staff worked diligently to provide with the room of our request (our room was on a high floor near but not too close to the elevator) for the service we would expect in the hotel industry. The front desk staff took the time to explain what was available to us, hotel information about the property, and all things related to this hotel. They have some stores on the property and well as a few restaurants, dine + drink spots and a really nice bar atmosphere.For the tech savvy...LOVE LOVE LOVE THE HOTEL'S TEXT MESSAGING OPTION for room service, questions and any concerns you might have. Replies were received efficient and requests were handled decently and accordingly. Just remember to make sure your ""DO NOT DISTURB"" button is turned off to they may knock on your door if you request room service or need assistance with handling room-type issues. Definitely a great use of technology!Loews Miami Beach Hotel is close and within walking distance to certain shops, restaurants and nightlife, and there were never any issues obtaining proper transportation to and from the hotel. Uber and Lyft were available just right outside the hotel in their main entrance area off the right side with designated signs, and they were available regularly.There was only one incident during 3AM where the fire alarm went off but the hotel staff handled the situation accordingly, and guests who were affected and expressed concerns were taken care of accordingly.Overall, the Loews Miami Beach Hotel is immaculate and very maintained, rooms are of decent size, and overall I enjoyed a fabulous stay at this hotel I would definitely return.","July 9, 2019","5    Loews Miami Beach Hotel

317,"Stayed at the Lowes over 4th Weekend — Hotel was great! For a busy time of year everything was well organised and slickly run. We stayed in a double room (2 adults + 2 kids) which was big enough for the little time we spent in there. The hotel can get a little noisy - it’s Miami after all with both excited early morning rising kids and late night teens, so if you are noise sensitive you may want to choose a different location. The restaurants in the hotel are good (a little pricey) but there are so many options in the local area that you’re not only confined to the hotel eateries. We loved the location to the beach (the water was clear and beautiful) as well as the pool area. Again this can get a little busy as there is Only one pool catering for everyone, but the hotel is organised so that everyone can find a sun lounger and a place to enjoy the sun. Hotel staff are hard working, polite and superb! Our kids spent an afternoon at SOBE kidsClub which they loved, there’s a fantastic games room and cinema room for when they’ve exhausted the sun and pool.

328,"I must say this hotel is perfectly situated in proximity to local retail outlets, south beach, etc. The hotel property itself is very nice with friendly staff. I don’t have complaints of the lack of dinning options on the premises due to the fact you can literally walk outside down either direction and find numerous venues less or equivalent in terms of pricing. The pool area is sufficient. I enjoyed the spa, and overall my room was quite nice. I certainly would request your room away from the maintenance/housekeeping’s main office or doorway since they were constantly in and out which I always heard at all times. This could just be a coincidence of my room on my particular floor. The reason I likely will not stay here again is the fact that there were too many families with small children and what appeared to be corporate events going on. And with work groups are of course the obnoxious drinking older crowd at the pool and restaurant a couple days and nights. FYI, the pool area can get cramped and the water is rather warm which I don’t typically recall elsewhere. The beach area is just okay so I recommend walking down closer to ocean drive. I suppose for couples dating like myself and not having children this property didn’t cater to our specific demographic so well. So for those like us, I recommend a different resort. For families this appears to be a good fit. Location is prime regardless & this hotels best attribute. Rates are actually very good for the 4 star rating they have. I have paid much more for similar, so no complaints on this point. Just my thoughts. ","June 29, 2019","5    Loews Miami Beach Hotel

335,"Our first day we spent lunch at bar Collins. We had a server who didn't address us until after sitting for 30 minutes. It was busy and that's understandable but after she finally addressed our table drinks took another 20 minutes to receive and blamed on the bar being busy as we watched nothing was rang in and food was dropped 30 minutes later. The food we ordered was incorrect and cold. The server never came back to the table so I just asked the only person walking by and I informed her the burger was not cooked correctly and fries were ice cold. She replaced the fries with more cold fries and left. The server dropped the check without informing us of any gratuity included without any salutation. For what we paid for a lunch I was immensely unimpressed with the lack of service and carelessness shown to us. No apologies were offered and we were sent on our way as if the service charge was deserved. This was not the service or respect we felt deserved for paying the amount owed. The next day we went to the pool and sat by the bar. Women’s soccer was on so the 2 bartenders were preoccupied watching the televisions. It took a while to order and receive drinks and food. Food was okay but service was subpar. Again 20% was added to the bill but not mentioned and definitely not deserved. Later that night we spent the evening for happy hour at lure. It was our best experience with the bartender from Tallahassee but can’t remember his name. He was exceptional. He spent time talking with us and told us more about the hotel and restaurant answered all of our questions with delight and interest. He informed us of the gratuity being built and I gladly tipped him an extra $20 for his awesome service on top of our bill. Aside from this gentlemen, our experience was not pleasant. It felt as though the employees thought they deserved the 20% for being there. I don’t mind paying gratuity when deserved but the staff was subpar all around and not deserving of their overpriced drinks and food and built in grat. I addressed this with the hotel and someone was supposed to get back to me about our experience and never heard anything. Don’t waste your time or money here unless visiting lure fish bar. The staff is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the south beach service we received while on our trip. I have a lot of patience when it comes to service but after giving so many opportunities to different outlets we were let down so many times and I gave up on the hotel and did not want to waste time or money on the restaurants inside the hotel so we ventured out to get away.

The staff were so warm and welcoming where ever we went in the hotel. Special shout out to Alex on the front desk who was so lovely to us and made us feel like old friends returning home. Josh helped us to our room after a tour and sorted out our bags. The weekend we were there was across the American Black Film Festival and the hotel was super busy. But I think this made the stay even better, it was such a great atmosphere and everyone there was really friendly and happy. Could not have asked for a better time in Miami.I would go back there tomorrow. Our room was 1651 - great views of Miami beach and the city with everything you could need in the room. The beach is a short walk over the sand dune. The pool area is huge and was lively as it was a busy weekend. The staff around the pool are a credit to this hotel and took great care of our family.

344,"This was my first visit to the Miami Beach area and to the Loews Hotel. What has stood out to myself has been the “Can Do” attitude to looking after the hotel guests. From a simple thing by the waiters at breakfast by offering a coffee or an orange juice to go when leaving the table when you’d finished your breakfast. Another example of a can do attitude was from Craig one of the swimming pool area attendants. Having been walking on the beach first thing in the morning, I left my Croc footwear on top of a towel at the beach and when I returned my Crocs had disappeared from on top of my towel. When going back to the hotel I spoke to Craig as I didn’t want to walk through the lobby of the hotel going back to my room with bare wet feet. Craig said “leave it with me” and went to the spa returning with a proper pair of sandals for me to use!

360,My boyfriend and I visited South Beach last month and the trip was Beyond amazing starting with the check-in at the Marseilles hotel! I am in the hospitality industry and good customer service is always a MUST where I spend my hard earned money. Check in was simple and easy our room type wasn’t available so they UPGRADED us to a KING JACUZZI SUITE! The room was super clean! Desmond was very professional friendly and exceeded my customer service expectations the pool was amazing the happy hour at the hotel was amazing the beach access was LIT! We were in the heart of South Beach super convenient. I would recommend this hotel to anybody coming to South Beach! This will be where I book my hotel when I visit from now on.

It was a major turn down pool area and the rest is closed after 10 pm up until 8 am. I understand security concerns but hire a guard or something! is not fair to not allow guests to be in this area and use the pool, very strange and unusual policy.

372,"we really enjoyed staying at this hotel. the pros: the backyard area is awesome with the pool (and amazing pool manager Mykel), hot tub, games like ping pong, the bar (and awesome bartender Tatiana!). The hotel is right on the beach and includes chairs and umbrella everyday. The food in the backyard area is very good too and there is free happy hour every day. They also offered the ability to have a later checkout by paying an hourly fee, awesome for us since we had a late flight. We also had a view of both the ocean and the strip. cons: really only one: It seems they did a renovation recently, and while the finishes and everything are modern, it still has a small bathroom, windows that dont open and doors that allow you to hear everything in the hall. Even with that negative I would definitely stay here again, it is a small family run boutique hotel as opposed to many of the large corporate chains and I like the boutique and family feel.

Their flooring around the pool is something like a marbel. And at the present time they appear to be waiting to get it coated to make it non slip - it is VERY slippery.They gave three rubber mats covering a very large area, which really isn’t very good at all.The pool guy, Michael told us they are waiting on the coating to be done, and has ordered more mats.Hopefully they now have more mats before someone really hurts themselves.A lovely hotel, great position, but in my opinion - not safe around the pool.","January 1, 2019","6    Marseilles Hotel

379,"Quite possibly the worse hotel I’ve stayed in for staff assistance. We checked in for our honeymoon, Gaby was rude and explained we had no booking. Once I presented her with our webjet voucher she proceeded to call people to find us a room. We got a room so atleast that’s something. Even though we speak English reception had a lot of trouble understanding us.We no assistance with bags, and the elevators are super slow. I would suggest using the stairs. Rooms are noisy, don’t expect a lay in when house cleaning is walking around banging from 10am. You probably won’t get a lay in anyway as the blinds don’t block out any sun. Also suggest running the hot water 15 mins before you need to shower as that’s how long it takes to heat up. Our safe didn’t work either, we didn’t bother getting them to fix it. you also share a balcony with another room.It’s a great location for the price, I guess we all just expected a little bit more.

The maids clean up the room very nice.It’s very expensive to eat at the Miami beach also at the hotel so sometimes you want to eat at the room and you also just want to eat at the room because you are tired and want to relax. So we make the misstake to ask if we could borrow two knifes/forks (nicer to eat whith than plastic). No absoltly not! The frontdesk tried to help us but the resturant said no. In the end they come with one plastic knife and fork. But we are two. No you just get one. We are staying on this hotel for 16 nights! and they refuse to lend us something to eat with.

For starters, its location is great, the pool area is wonderful and the rooms are large, albeit a bit old, since all the buildings on Collins are from the 40s and 50s, I guess. Now, the problems. Breakfast is ""a la carte"", which isn't bad in itself. The problem happens when you only have one person attending, so arm yourself with patience. But there are lots of alternatives for breakfast in the neighborhood, so that's not a deal breaker.The main problem is the noisy teens. The hotel hosted busloads of hysterical teenager girls for the 3 night I was there, so yelling, screaming and door banging at 3AM became normal. I understand that a business must not refuse customers, but either you are a ""boutique hotel” or a summer camp, you can’t be both. I heard lots of people complaining and that might hurt evaluations a bit. Truth be told, the girls were a bit quieter on the last night, I don’t know because management talked to them or if because the newcomers were more polite than the ones that left, but I don’t want my good night of sleep to be that random.","July 16, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

It felt a bit desperate in all honesty. The Happy Hour is very good and the barman is a good guy.Room was clean, of a reasonable size and had all the amenities you would require. Cons:At night the hotel is very loud - it’s very difficult to get a good nights sleep as you have other guests shouting and running up and down the hotel corridors at all hours.

That being said, it was a very loud and weird clientele. One night there was a drunk fight in my hallway. Maybe that's what you attract with ""free cocktails"" at happy hour? (Not surprising, the bartenders were by far the best of the staff). The chamber maids only replaced a couple towels, and never the washcloths. There were odd noises all hours of the night (metal marbles rolling???), and the mattress was old and very noisy (unsure what kind of mattress makes squeaky noises). The rooms on the whole need updating, and the staff needs better training. Unprofessional and unfriendly overall. I would not come back.","April 26, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

398,"The location was perfect. Disappointed that there was no gym, And you can't actually get a free drink at happy hour because the line is so long, but everything else was great. The backyard area is beautiful, with hammocks and lawn games and a hot tub. The guy who helps around the pool, Eddy, was our favorite. He was kind and knowledgeable and an asset to the hotel. We had a great time!","April 23, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

399,Reception staff are friendly throughout. Hotel in need of an update it’s ok value for money compared to south beach. Bar closes early and food is ok nothing special. Pool area is clean although again the bar area needs updating. Location is the best part of this hotel being right near the beach where u get a sunbed pass. I know other reviews found it to be noisy but we found it ok on both 7th and 8th floor. Negatives are that the air con is so noisy you simply can’t have it on if you are sleeping. Strange flies kept appearing in our bathroom and the cleaners don’t leave coffee for the next day so we kept having to ask everyday which gets slightly annoying. Again the rooms need updating. We probably wouldn’t stay here again but it was an ok stay. Avoid Maxine’s restaurant opposite the service and food is horrendous. ,"April 12, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

The view was not oceanfront but oceanview from the living room but not the bedroom. Not exactly what I wanted but it was only one night. Great shower but small sink area.

401,"Arrived late afternoon and room was ready. Unfortunately, it was Music Week and the SLS hotel next to the Marseilles was playing very loud non stop music all afternoon and night. The hotel should have notified guests that the music was going to be loud and non stop. To make matters worst, we paid top dollar for the room. It a comfort stay. The hotel is at best a 2 Star hotel with the rooms one or two steps above a college dorm room. Would not recommend the Marseilles. Not my cup of tea. ","March 21, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

402,It was our second time visiting the Marseilles hotel. The boutique style hotel is located on Collins Ave so your close to all what Miami has to offer accept not In the middle of everything. The hotel is very clean and the staff is awesome. Everyone there is very attentive and always making sure your stay is going well. Every employee that I had the pleasure of meeting was sooo friendly and helpful to all our needs. Highly recommend there breakfast on there front porch and having lunch at there gorgeous pool/outdoor bar. I recommend everything on it!! They also have cabanas to rent that was reasonable. Staying at the Marseilles also means your on the beach and they gave us 2 chairs and sn umbrella everyday (no extra charge). Can't wait to go back again!! Highly recommend it!! ,"March 11, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

403,"It's obviously an old hotel, and considering the other hotels in the area it seems to be on par unless you stay further up north at some of the larger more modern resorts. Rooms were very small with some cheap minor cosmetic updates to keep it from looking horribly outdated. The door is about 2.5 feet from the bed, so when someone opens it, you are basically on display in your bed. Our door had a vent near the bottom which allowed us to hear every little thing in the hallway. I assume they could hear every noise we made as well. The hot water initially took over 10 minutes to come on. I had called the front desk and they said just wait for it. Staff was nice, especially the pool attendant. The pool was heated and very warm! The free happy hour was bad. Only mixed drinks and only the drinks listed on a the happy hour menu (no beer, wine, Mojitos). Even free wasn't worth it to me to have a drink that I don't want. There were probably 5 other people at the happy hour and none of them looked too thrilled with it either. I found this hotel to be rather quiet in terms of street noise and guest spirit.","March 6, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

404,"We arrived on a Tuesday morning by 10 am and the room wasn’t ready so we checked our bags, changed into our suits and made it out to the amazing pool area. Pool bar opened at 11 so we hadn’t few drinks and went to check on our room. It still wasn’t ready so we changed and headed down to Ocean Drive for lunch and drinks. We stumbled upon this great $.99 taco place and sat outside and had a great lunch It was called Down N Dirty Tacos and we went there 2 times!!! We ventured a little further and stopped at the Cleavelander for a drink and to Mangos. Then made our way back to check in. It was after 3pm and our room was ready. It was on the 8 th floor corner room with the most amazing view! Headed to the beach for a little bit before going back to change for the evening. They have a really cool happy hour from 6-7 pm for all hotel guests. It was a great atmosphere and a good prep before heading out for dinner. We walked along Collins Ave and stumbled upon Espanola Way and we were glad we did. The atmosphere was awesome and we ate at a Cuban Restaurant outside.Definately plan on having dinner on Espanola Way! The next day we rented the Citibikes which were free. Ask at the front desk for the passes. The boardwalk is right outside the hotel and very active in the am. Had a great healthy breakfast at a little eating place and went back to go to the beach. The hotel gives you a beach pass and you get 2 chairs and an umbrella....good deal. Water was a little cold. The weather was perfect. The bartender def at the outside bar Maria was a total gem and asset to the hotel. She was the most memorable staff member we had encountered. Super sweet, professional, and happy! Happy hour was very crowded that evening and she worked so hard for the 6-7 pm hour; it was non stop. The second night we ate at the awesome italien restaurant at Espanola Way. The next day we ate across the street at Maxines for lunch. There was live music and the food was really good.The room was really nice. King bed. The bathroom was small but who cares! The indoor bar is NOT the place to go at night. That’s all I’m saying. The outdoor backyard is awesome. We played games, hung out on the beds and had the most amazing vacation.The man who works the pool area is super attentive and a very hard worker! And once again Maria is a doll! I would recommend this hotel to families and couples. There’s so much to do and everything is walkable. We are planning a family trip there next February .

405,"Let me start off saying I would stay here again. 4 of us (2 couples) went down for a quick 4-day trip over President's Day weekend. The hotel was full the entire time we were there with mostly families.  The rooms and bathrooms are small but nice and clean. Our only issue was that we work even on vacation and our room didn't have a desk but the other couples room did. Our room was right next to the elevator bank and I was worried about noise but the noise was minimal.  The pool area is too small for the hotel and there is a sister hotel 1/2 block away that apparently gives their guests privileges at the Marseilles.One side of the pool deck has 4 large lounge beds and as nice as these seem to be, they should have more chairs so that there are more places to sit and relax. If you didn't claim a chair early, you were pretty much out of luck. The staff was everything a good hotel could ask for. At the pool, Mykel was in constant motion and made sure we had everything we needed for the pool. He was very helpful recommending restaurants and things to do. He explained the beach chairs and what time we should come down in the morning to get a chair poolside. He was very endearing and constantly checking on everyone at the pool and if the guests needed anything. Alberto was also on the pool deck but it seemed like he was everywhere in the hotel. He was so attentive to the guests but there was an elderly lady with mobility issues and he held her hand as she was climbing in and out of the pool with such care, it was beyond just doing his job. There was also a gentleman in a wheelchair and Alberto made sure she needed nothing and helped push him to a chair and get in and out of the wheelchair. I hope if the owners or managers read this they realize what assets these 2 gentlemen are to the hotel.  Happy hour is free but they do request a $1.00 tip per drink. The menu is set but has about two dozen or so drinks on it. There is only 1 bartender and the first night the lines were so long we could only get 1 drink but the other nights were not as bad. There is a restaurant on the premises but we did not eat there.  Overall, the stay was nice and we will be back. The staff is amazing and the pool is nice especially if you can get a chair.","February 22, 2018","6    Marseilles Hotel

407,"My wife and I - a Danish couple - arrived at the hotel on a cold evening of January 2018 - without our luggage from the flight. We were supposed to be there 4 days before embarking on a cruise We met the owner Lloyd - a very very kind, friendly an helpful man who offered us to bring us warmer clothes, drive to a place where we could by some and generally informed us, that we always could call him - also during the night - in case we needed anything - simply incredible - thank you Lloyd! Lloyd also introduced us to his sales Director Sus Olsen who also is Danish. Sus continued where Lloyd left us - Sje contacted our airline and arranged a quick delivery of our luggage - and furthermore arranged, that the full day we had in miami after the cruise and untill our flight, we could spend in one of their private cabanas in the garden to enjoy the sun, garden and the pool take a bath and dress. We did and we loved it and are highly grateful - thank you Sus. Not to mention the staff in reception, bar, lobby and garden - they all gave us some lovely days in Miami. Bars in lobby and garden are really nice with a very attractive happy hour. Rooms a very nice - the garden and pool area is simply a dream - and at the end of the garden is the beach.

Happy our at the pool bar was a welcome surprise too. The food that we had at the hotel was relatively inexpensive and of a good quality, on the days we were too tired to eat out this was a real bonus. We got upgraded to a family room on arrival which was very kind. My only observation is that the sound insulation between the rooms could do with improving, you could clearly hear our neighbours coming back from their boozy night out and becoming amorous!

427,"We enjoyed how clean and quiet the hotel was the first day we were there. The second morning of our stay we decided to go to the beach and use the chairs that we paid for with the $34 a day resort fee. We scored 2 chairs ocean front that were great and had a nice view. We then decided around lunchtime to walk up to get some lunch at a restaurant and was told that if we leave one of the hotel towels on the beach chairs that the seats would be there for us when we returned. By the way, these towels would cost us $25 a piece if we didn’t hand them back into the Redbury. When we returned from lunch about 40 minutes later, our seats were given to another couple and our towel was missing. When we approached the women at the cabana that deals with the chairs she gave me attitude and told me to calm down even though I was just trying to locate my towel and get an understanding of why our seats were gone. I would think that our seats would still be there because we were told that it was ok to leave for a little bit to have lunch. I had to ask to speak to a manager just to have them look for our towel. The manger did come back about 10 minutes later with our towel but really didn’t care that our seats were gone. I don’t think that I will be staying here again considering there are so many other options on this strip that would care if you were happy or not with their service.","May 19, 2019","7    The Redbury South Beach

Very nicely decorated, and the record player was a nice touch! Bathroom was also nice and large! However, in terms of our stay there were several problems. We were told the included beach chairs were part of the Delano hotel. When we arrived on the beach we were told this was no longer the case, and there seemed to be a bit of confusion where we were meant to go. Eventually the Richmond hotel chairs is where we ended up - which wasn’t as nice. Then for our “included” breakfast they only gave us a voucher for one person — although the booking was CLEARLY for two people (the fact two people were there during check in, two beach chairs, enough towels for two people, etc) and when we tried to rectify this they said no it’s for one person. (Ridiculous!!) Finally a fire alarm went off at around 8am on our last morning and no one came out to tell us when it was safe to come back in or told us what happened...

433,"Spent several nights recently at The Redbury South Beach. Overall a very pleasant stay... room was good sized, king bed comfy, nice amenities, polite staff. If I wanted to be picky perhaps I'd say that the carpet in the room looked a teeny bit used in spots, but rest of room was spot on. Upstairs, the small pool and large deck space was a pleasure. During our visit it was never very crowded, which gave it a nice private feel. As another reviewer mentioned, it would be nice if there was a bar or something similar on the roof, and, true, the included breakfast did not offer much by way of options (yogurt or cereal, plain/chocolate/blueberry and cheese croissant, some fruit.. blueberries and strawberries, fresh orange juice and coffee... though coffee was lukewarm on two days), but it wasn't bad at all. The breakfast is served in the nice attached restaurant, so included regular sit-down service. In the mornings, sitting at a table outside was very nice. I must say too that I had to ask each day for a card voucher for it, which seemed a little unnecessary, and it was not volunteered until I asked (so missed the first day). The room included access to the Delano and their beach chairs, which was quite nice too. Note though that the chairs do not include an umbrella, which is extra if you wish for one.On the one day it rained during our visit, the hotel's free umbrellas were a great help.All in all, we were quite happy with our stay.","March 28, 2019","7    The Redbury South Beach

Valet parking only, which is $42 per night(extra $84 didn't know about until check in for our 2 nights) very inconvenient, we waited 40 minutes for our car after checkout.

435,"Stayed at the Redbury in South Beach for NYE 2018. Well priced and very well located for what we wanted, and offers great beach facilities as part of its' sister hotel. However, I don't think it can call itself a 'boutique' hotel. It felt quite corporate, and a little tired/lacklustre in everything from the decor to the extremely poor reception staff. But, it definitely ticks the boxes for those looking for an affordable option in the heart of the bustling strip. And the bed was extremely comfortable!","March 17, 2019","7    The Redbury South Beach

436,"We stayed for 4 nights at the hotel. On arrival the check in was a bit chaotic. She didn’t seem to be experienced and even though we arrived at 7.00pm, she suggested that our room was not ready?! Not what you want to hear after a 13 hour flight. Tried to book the restaurant ‘Cleo’ the same night - was told it was not busy and so just turn up. When we arrived an hour later after freshening up - there were no tables! Would have made sense for the concierge to reserve the table for us as we had initially asked. The room was nice and clean. The WiFi was good quality and the record player was a nice touch. Good quality sound system and TV. The shower was disappointing- the water was just not hot even on max. Booking the Redbury gives you access to the Delano hotel beach and gym over the road which was a relief as it was a far superior hotel with impeccable front desk staff. There was no access to SLS with the reservation which was not clear on booking. The Cleo restaurant staff left a lot to be desired. One even suggested there were no tables free when the restaurant was half empty. Had to mention we we guests and luckily another kind member of staff stepped in and got us a table straight away.Overall I would say it’s a fairly average hotel with nice comfortable rooms but the customer service needs to improve drastically for it to be competitive as there are lots of other great hotels on south beach.

437,"I chose the Redbury because of all of the positive reviews and it did not disappoint! The hotel is in a perfect location amongst some of the highest-end hotels in South beach (including SLS & Delono) and is walking distance to Ocean drive, shopping, restaurants and of course the beach. The rooms are large and very nicely decorated, we also enjoyed having the record player as something unique! Note that the hotel seems to have changed it's agreement with SLS since the beach chairs were with the Delono hotel now but they are just as nice! A special shout out to Fed at the Delono beach who took excellent care of us during our stay! They do charge extra for an umbrella even if the chairs are included in your reservation, I think this is standard. The staff at the Redbury are very helpful and even did something special for my husband's birthday and also knew that we were Expedia Gold members. The pool has nice rooftop views and is not very busy so you don't have to worry about getting chairs at any time of day. The only surprise we had was that our reservation did not include the continental breakfast (I assumed that it was included in the daily resort fee based on reading reviews), so I would suggest checking this before you make your booking. It wasn't a big deal since there are lots of breakfast options close by! I would definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in south beach, we loved it!","February 27, 2019","7    The Redbury South Beach

444,"Stayed here February 2018, have been to South beach before and the Redbury made the short list before and this time we decided to stay.Rooms are good, bathroom fine - decent facilities in the bedroom. Pool area is spacious, but isn't laid out that well. There's a lack of umbrellas around the pool, so if you want to be by the pool,but under shade there wasn't a great selection. There isn't a bar at the pool side, which seems a bit weird. There's a bar downstairs but that doesn't open until 5. The advice was to go next door to the venue next door to get a drink. Restaurant serves really good food. I was skeptical of how the food would be, but the food is definitely worth a visit. The ambience in the restaurant is okay, the staff - especially the bar staff are really lovely. One of the Managers (male) seemed to have radar ears for breaking glass/plates and did shout at one member of staff within my hearing - not great. Would l stay here again? No. It is a good hotel, but all felt a little disjointed and the pool deck was a disappointment for me. ","February 9, 2019","7    The Redbury South Beach

At only two blocks there is a walgreens, in a 15 minute walk you will find a Publix to get more groceries.

471,"Has its ups and downs. The ups are the staff is very nice, the grounds are lovely. The A/C units worked great. For an off beach hotel, the location is not bad. Note on transportation: parking is around $30 a day. We road Uber which was great, and there is a free trolley that goes up and down Collins that’s great. Just be aware that it doesn’t run late into the evening. The room was clean, but there was a bit of a mildew smell when we first walked in, however, it must not be a huge problem because we got used to it quickly. The room was clean and the housekeepers were. very good. The downs which aren’t really a big deal: there was no corkscrew, bottle opener or can opener in the kitchen. This seems ridiculous to me because people on vacation are going to want those items at their disposal. The office had them, but what an inconvenience to have to walk to the office for a can opener! The pool area is small for the size of the hotel. There aren’t enough chairs and umbrellas. I don’t know how often they clean the pool but by the 5th day we were there it was pretty gross.

476,Me and my girlfriend stayed there for a week. The rooms were cleaned every day and staff were friendly. The hotel is a bit old so might need refurbishment. The air cons were loud.Also parking in the area is difficult and expensive but we managed to park across the road for $1 an hour and it was free between 6pm and 8am. Also the residential parking is available to park in between 7am-6pm on weekdays only. Otherwise the hotel charges $32 per day for parking. We had a room on ground floor facing the street so on a few occasions we were woken up by loud noises.

477,"I read many reviews before booking my stay here and the price was wonderful for what you would get. A few of the pros is there is a lot of space in an apartment. I didn’t travel with my family but I could see how it could be perfect for a family with kids. The kitchen came equipped with all the essentials. Bathroom was small but clean and shower was good. Tons of storage to put away your stuff. The pool area was better than I was expecting with loungers, umbrellas, and a few cabanas. They did a great job with landscaping to make it cute. It is located only 6 minutes walk from the beach which we definitely took advantage of! The cons were the room did have an odd smell and although the front desk was very helpful, we could never reach them via phone. No one picked up ever so we had to always go there in person if we needed anything. The living room could have had more furniture in it to make more useable/comfortable. And I did see a large worm in the bathroom my last morning there. :( I was excited there was a free shuttle service to and from mia international airport and it was one of the reasons we booked it. But I couldn’t use it either time because my flight arrived too late (by a half hour) and the shuttle wasn’t available, and leaving for the airport, my options were 8am which was too early to take the shuttle for a noon flight and the 10am was too risky. The front desk people told me that even tho it is supposed to arrive at 10am-it could take as long as 10:30. Which meant I could be cutting it too close to my flight departure if it left at 10:30 and reached to the airport by 11. So unfortunately couldn’t take advantage of the free shuttle either time. I would come back here if there were not other options. It wasn’t bad. But I have stayed in better hotels that were in the same price range with none of these cons.

Came here with our daughter this time and are staying in a room with 2 beds. First night, our daughter went to sleep in 1 bed and when we went to bed later, 1 side of the bed was completely broken so we all squeezed in to my daughters queen bed. Super uncomfortable The next morning, we had to wait for a repair because it was booked and we couldnt be moved. Killed a half a day waiting for a ""repair"". I had to keep following up with the front desk. finally spoke to a manager. Room is not clean at all. See pics. Everything has a gross moldy smellKitchen has rusty utensils. Next door neighbors were so loud yesterday we couldn't sleep. The pool has a total of 12 lounger chairs for hundreds of rooms-better get there early if you want one or be a hawk when people leave a chair. Also, no towels by the pool-go to the lobby to get that. We booked through hotels.com who called the hotel to try to cancel the remainder of our reservations and they refused. Hotels.com said to try to cancel with the hotel. Back to the front desk we go.

Loose fixtures, chipped tub, sloppy paint and mildew everywhere. The shower temp fluctuates from cold to scalding every 1-2 minutes so be prepared to dash out of the stream to avoid getting seriously burned. The iron was unusable it is so caked with black gunk. They provide a coffee maker but no coffee so you have to provide that yourself. We heard the guests above us clear as a bell as they listened to music until midnight, moved about in the apartment and someone banging on their door and yelling at 4 AM. The worst was the rodents scratching inside the walls at all hours. I didn’t get a visual but a mouse or rat fell into our closet in the middle of the night and rattled the hangers. Thank god the closet door was closed. There is a trash pen right outside the bedroom wall so we assume they are coming in there. There is a large hole in the ceiling of the closet for them to access.

Let staff know next day that tv was broke, a contact lense on bedroom floor, hair in shower and on toilet. Toilet fixed day two but broke again night five. Housekeeper had very dirty large dry mop to clean our room.. Night two No tv. Called about 15 times. Told he is only one at desk cannot leave to try to fix tv. A second night of little sleep. Tv fixed day three but no message sent to supervisor Rudy about some type of compensation. Next night could hear loud music undermeath room. Tried to call front desk 8 times. Just ramg. Its a long walk to front desk and I have medical problems. Reported comcerns next day. Nothing communicated to supervisor Rudy Last night in hotel loud music going until 12:30 or 1:00 am. TV broke again. Cannotfix it because language that comes up on tv is in Spanish. Called again and again. Made long walk three times to front desk about noise complaint/broken tv and large hairball left in bathroom. . Kept others awake too next door and my friend. Another night of poor sleeping. I email picture of it per front deak. No doubt from filthy mop. Our beds were changed even though we advised plz dont change sheets. Had things on bed. Apparently Rudy is ONLY one who I can talk to about problems. I was told last night he would call when he gets in at 10 am. At 10:10 am I called from airport. He was not in. Asked for call back. No call Called at 5:20 pm. He was “unavailable “. but Gemaine assured me he would call me back in few minutes. I gave my number four times. At 6:10 pm I called about four times.

Perfect quiet lovely place to lounge by the pool. While only being a short walk from the hubbub of South Beach excitement. It was a pleasure to spend two nights at this fantastic location.

509,"The tradewinds is 10-15 mins walk to lincoln road mall. 3-4 mins to the beach, a 24 hr petrol station next door. Our apartment was a one bedroom with the living room and kitchen facing the pool courtyard. It was quiet when sleeping and didnt hear any noise from the pool. the pool area was comfortable and the pool nice. Although the techno music around the pool was too loud and not relaxing. the apartment had all kitchen needs for a rental and the place was clean with 4 towels for the 2 of us. The staff were pleasant and available but never over presnt or pushy. The bed was ok, could probably do with an upgrade. the bed cover was weird too being 2 sheets around the comforter. The air conditioner is also quiet and effective. We felt secure in the room too as there were locks on the courtyard we were in, though that wouldnt be the case with all rooms.

519,"The location was great, although we did have to pass by some interesting homeless people, but I was fine with that. If you have a vehicle, street parking gets a little tricky depending on time and days. You can get lucky and park for free half the time, or end up paying the meters the other half, so try to do your research in that regards. The front desk people were very friendly and provided excellent service all the time I was there. The whole experience would be a 5, but I gave it just a 3 because of the apt itself. Its not horrible, but just okay for me due to oldness of the room, some needed modernization, and a few roaches. Otherwise, as a place to just rest your head for the night from partying or the beach, the affordability was great compared to most area accommodations.","October 10, 2018","8    Tradewinds Apartment Hotel

The hotel is nice, more like a condo type of building. The only thing I didn't like was the strong scary sound of the fire alarm one night, thanks god when we came out of the room, Adrian was there with the firefighters and aparently someone was smoking in one of the rooms.

531,"When I arrived at 10 AM June 26-1, I was told I was going get a text alerting me when my room was ready...it never came. When guests arrive early and their room is not ready you should offer some type of wrist band so that they can go to the beach and move around the hotel without a baggage claim ticket/or wallet. The bathroom sink is flawed… When you turn the water pressure on it hits the drain and sprays all over you.The shower is seriously flawed.. a pool of water ran out onto the floor every time I used it. This is the 4th time I’ve stayed at his hotel and it still continues to happen every time“TV” dining option was never available…”unable to connect message.”There is no room to put any personal items in the refrigerator so you can only drink what you have in there (soda, beer or liquor which I don’t drink).

532,"The positives: Great location with beach access. Free bike rentals for guests. The food was pretty good. The negatives: We were on our honeymoon and I made note of this on the booking form. They replied by email saying they couldn't do anything for us. We stayed at two other hotels on this trip and both of them went above and beyond to make our stay special. Complimentary bubbly and fruit in the room for example. On arrival at the Shelborne we checked in and were given no information about the hotel or our stay. We weren't asked how our trip was or anything, so I didn't mention our honeymoon. When we got to the room there was no literature there with hotel information. Nothing except a price list for the phone. We called reception and asked for a mini bar price list. They brought us up a room service menu. (we got the mini bar price list later from the concierge). The TV in the room had an interactive information menu, but that didn't work. The room, an ocean view King, is nicely decorated but quite small, particularly the bathroom which was tiny. The bed was comfortable though and the room was quiet.The balcony was a real let down. It was extremely noisy out there due to some extraction ducts above us. This ran 24/7 and made the balcony impossible to enjoy as you could hardly have a conversation over the noise. The view was lovely but the furniture on the balcony was outrageous. The white iron table was rotting with rust. The wicker chairs and table were in tatters at the bottom, literally falling apart.We went to reception and asked if they had another room, with a less noisy balcony. They told us the only room they could give us had a smaller balcony and we'd be better off in our own room, so we took their word for it and stayed where we were. Cleanliness was a bit of an issue at this hotel. The shower has two heads, an overhead rain one, which was fine, and a standard hand held body shower head. This one had some really black mould all over it. Not nice. We had major issues with house keeping. They knocked on our door just before 10am the first morning and we were not ready to leave so we asked them to come back later. We went out a short time later, leaving the ""please come in"" sign on the door. When we got back 3 hours later the room hadn't been serviced. We called reception and they said they would send someone up. They brought us towels but our room was not serviced that day. The next day we left our room and passing reception asked them to make sure to have our room cleaned. We spent the entire day on the beach and when we got back in the afternoon again our room was not cleaned. We had no clean towels and the thrash can was full. A call from my wife to reception was met with excuses and some nonsense about housekeeping finishing at 5pm so they may not be able to assist us. We said this was unacceptable and they said they would try to get it sorted. 10 minutes later we got clean towels and about 30 minutes later housekeeping came to clean our room while my wife was showering. So we had to have them clean the bedroom, then when my wife finished showering they did the bathroom. The rest of our 5 night stay involved me calling reception to have the room cleaned every day because if we didn't let the cleaners in when they knocked in the morning, they weren't coming back. The floor was never vacuumed once during our stay and was filthy by the time we left. The pool area was generally busy but they close it at 7pm asking everyone to leave when it's still bright out. The pool side bars also close at this stage, and on one day much earlier ""because of the weather"". It was a lovely afternoon after a rainy morning. Numerous times the towels we got had blood or other stains on them and one that had a large hole in it. When my wife asked for a towel that wasn't stained she was told that the stain is nothing to worry about that they are clean towels. Seriously Shelborne, if you've got towels that don't clean up or have holes in them, dump them. Why are you giving them to people to use and making excuses? The mattresses on the pool side sun chairs were also showing signs of age, most quite mouldy from being damp. There are gates from the pool area to the beach which are key card controlled for access. They lock these with a padlock and chain at 7pm so they can't be used. This was frustrating because if you were on the beach in the evening you had to go the long way around to the front entrance. The gates are secure anyway, why make them unusable? In summary this was the most expensive hotel of our 2 week trip and we picked it because we thought it would be a special place to end our honeymoon. It was the biggest disappointment of any hotel I've stayed in. ","July 1, 2019","9    Shelborne South Beach

534,"We looked forward to flying in from Kentucky for our family vacation at this property. We checked into the hotel at checkin time and went up to our room to do a quick change into our bathing suits to head out to the beach. When you go to the beach the beach attendants ask you for your room number and provide towels and two chairs. (Knowing what we know now...this is probably where things turned south). About 2 hours later we went back to the room to get ready for dinner, we grabbed our wallets/purses and left hotel to eat. When we went to pay, we all discovered ALL our cash was stolen out of wallets!!! Totalling $400! I travel the world for a living and have never had this happen, EVER! All the cash from my child's wallet was taken as well. Heartless human being! It had to have been an in house theft ring since the beach attendants knew we were at the beach after they took our room number for towels. No electronics or jewelry were stolen just cash. That just shows that the hotel criminal did not want to be caught with items. I immediately called Miami police to file a report and contacted the manager at the front desk. Armando Cerda was the manager and he remained emotionless as I frantically reported the incident. He never took notes and seemed uninterested. I get the feeling this happens frequently there. He never apologized. He told me Ernesto the chief of security will call me to follow up. I never heard anything from the hotel about this incident. I wanted a log of the key card entries from that 2 hour window and for them to check the security camera facing the elevator and my room. Of course they were all tight lipped. We felt unsafe at this property, we immediately checked out and went to another property. I think they are all involved. This hotel is corrupt on the inside. I will never be back and I want the world to know they are not safe if they stay here. Nice on the outside, criminals on the inside. This ruined my whole vacation.

And that was probably my only concern with this place, the front desk wasn't super-professional. Or maybe it's us who have very high expectations. Anyhow, the breakfast was great. Service at the breakfast - even better. Rooms were fine. The price was good. Location was good. It was clean. All-in-all - really nice.I'm allergic to wall-to-wall carpets and this hotel had it.

544,"This is our 4th time in South Beach & our 4th hotel. The Shelborne certainly matched the others in location & style but did not have the same level of service! The one exception was Joseph at the beautiful pool where food & drinks were very good.On our arrival the receptionist was nice & efficient but no help was offered with our cases. At the bar the barman disappeared at 7.45pm & didn’t return until after 8pm another night (different barman) spent sometime with his phone before serving! Both were pleasant enough when they eventually served. Oddly for Miami we were told the bar closed at 10pm & the restaurant closes at 5pm.Our room was beautiful & a good size we also had a lovely balcony but strangely no furniture!! After several phone calls we got two chairs (a table would have been nice but we didn’t want to push it). Housekeeping seemed to forget about us each day we had to phone down at 5pm or later & ask for towels, the bins were never emptied. I note from other reviews this seems to be a problem, for a hotel of this size & type this should not be happening.I don’t mean this review to sound negative as overall we had an amazing time & would not rule out staying here again as it is a beautiful hotel in a great position where the staff are nice but inattentive. Improvement in service would make this hotel fabulous. I should mention.the beach is lovely & no problem with beach staff.","June 10, 2019","9    Shelborne South Beach

Also as far as service would like to thank Veral that helped us out everyday at the beach, great guy always smiling and appreciating. And least but not last Silvia (hope the name is right, the bartender/waiter by the pool) which provided us with great service through our cabana day at the pool.Drink were amazing we had the pleasurw to taste the simple but good Margarita as well as Piñacolada, for the food I definitrly suggestion the burger in the sandwhich secrion if you will be ordering by the pool or by the beach with a side of the tasteful yucca fries.Thank you for making our honey moon.Much Appreciated,Kevin Hessam","June 4, 2019","9    Shelborne South Beach

549,"Room: Our room wasn't ready at the said time of check-in. There was no communication about an extra wait and we were checked in an hour late. Nothing was offered to make-up for the delay and lack of communication and so I had to ask for a credit. Service: Joseph at the pool provided exceptional service to us. He always went above and beyond to find us lounge chairs, take our orders, and make sure we had everything we needed. Thank you, Joseph! The pool area is beautiful and I loved the free, chilled, and flavored water that was available. Room: The room was nice, but it didn't feel clean. The sink was not properly cleaned nor the shower when we arrived. It felt a little dirty but we were over waiting. Our room was only cleaned once during our 4 night stay because they never made it to us during the day and came by around 5/6 when we were getting ready for dinner. The last night they knocked on our door TWICE... once at 6 and again at 9pm asking if we needed it to be cleaned... we declined and just asked for fresh towels. However, they were really ready for us to the leave the day of checkout, being asked twice what time we were leaving.... two hours before required checkout time. Tacky. Breakfast: $25/person, but well worth the money. If you go out to eat elsewhere you will spend the same, but get less food. Overall, we would consider staying here again, but the lack of customer service was disappointing. Definitely room for growth in this area- although I know it is an issue for Miami in general.","May 25, 2019","9    Shelborne South Beach

563,"My husband and I had a trade show to attend in Miami at the Convention Center and were given several hotel recommendations. As we live in West Palm Beach and my husband is in Miami on a daily basis I asked him to check out the hotels. Upon his first stop he was so impressed with the Shelborne that he booked us right away! Our plan was to head down a day earlier to have a ""date day/night"" on Miami Beach. We arrived on 4/27/19 and realized that the junior king suite we had booked did not have a partial ocean view as our confirmation stated. After asking to speak with a manager I was introduced to Armando Cerda the manager on duty. After explaining how our date day had turned into a work day unloading and setting up at the convention center and then being disappointed there was no ocean view in our room, and mind you the hotel was completely booked, he asked me if we would mind waiting 20 minutes and would have a king room available with a partial ocean view. After about 5 mins we were informed our room was available. It was perfect!! Our room was on the 6th floor and the ""partial"" ocean view was a full view from the balcony of the room. We loved the quietness of the room which was tucked away in a small hallway with only 2 other rooms. Even tho they said the room was a little smaller then the junior suite it was perfect for the two of us!! We were so grateful to Armando for helping us with our accommodations so that our business/couples weekend was amazing!! We simply loved the view of the ocean every morning with our coffee from the in room coffee maker!! Great start to our long days!!After those long days, we were sure to visit our favorite lobby bartender Devonte for cooling cocktails and much laughter! He was always there with a smile, whether it was a cold drink you needed or ice for your room. Yes folks this hotel is an original from the past that has been beautifully remodeled but they managed to keep the old world charm. While my husband worked the trade show alone one day I was able to enjoy the beautiful beach and pool just minutes from my room where I again encountered friendly impeccable service. I was able to take one of the available bikes on the boardwalk that is between the hotel and the beach to the pier at the end of ocean avenue for a beautiful ride. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to nearby local restaurants and shopping. We never got back into our vehicle until the day we were checking out. So bottom line if you have the opportunity to be in Miami Beach either for business or pleasure you need to stay at the Shelborne. You will not be disappointed!! Stop in and say hi to Armando and the lobby bartender Devonte, their customer service was excellent!!","May 13, 2019","9    Shelborne South Beach

From a cost perspective, there are many hotels in this range, so if you've been here once, there is no need to return. The rooms, lobby, lobby bars, and entrance are beautiful and elegant. The gym is non-existent so if you're a health nut, don't bother... it's about 10*25 and 4 people is 1 too many. A big disappointment. The pool area is a hit and miss, food is mediocre, house music cranking all day as if it was the SLS... (its not the SLS). The Library - Piano bar.... if they could only get the proper talent in here. The current musician plays the wrong music. I had to ask one of the waitresses to stand up and sing some proper soul music. There's no planned playlist, anyways...

581,"This hotel has a great location. It is directly across from the beach. The hotel staff were excellent!! However the building itself is far from Marriott quality in any. The bathroom was horrible no vanity and very cramped. The walls were paper thin apparently and we heard everything from toilets flushing to arguments. Very noisy. Nothing about the building was quality. Dirty windows, bad view (we looked out at roof and ally) Refrigerator door fell off ( was promptly fixed). Dirty carpets. No pool. Very surprised because we are executive level and platinum elite and have been in a hundred Marriott hotels and resorts. The 3200 destination points required to book these 6 days were a rip off!","April 8, 2019","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

I thought it would be noisier, as we were on the second floor right over the restaurant, but once we closed the drapes we did not hear a thing. Staff is wonderful, there is a free HH on the rooftop nightly, bikes to use to ride along the seawall, and an amazing beach cart in each room with towels, umbrella, chairs etc.Each unit has a kitchen area, so nice to have a fridge to put in leftovers from the night before and some wine.Rooms clean, modern and spacious, bed VERY comfortable, A/C works great and good shower water pressure.

583,"We recently visited this place during our spring break. The mistake I made was the Spring Break and I am so Naïve and did not realize that it is such a horrible place for vacation during Spring Break. The Hotel is excellent and nice and has very good location. Would I come back again in the future, probably but definitely not during spring break. The Hotel staffs are very pleasant and helpful. The room is clean and spacious. I like the beach set and also the daily happy hour. The hotel also provided a list of area restaurants that you can have some discount and it is worth to use it. Honestly speaking, I am not a big fan of the restaurants in the area because their food quality is average comparing to the price they charge and they all put mandatory service fee (or call it tips) on your ticket and then try to get more on the final ticket. So watch out for that. I would not go to any of those restaurants without Marriott discount. We also found out it is actually very convenient to use public transportation to and from the Miami International airport if you are pressured by the time. One way trip took about 50 minutes and very comfortable and spacious Metrobus. Use Route 150. From the Airport, you would take the Metro mover to the Airport station and the departing Route 150 is on the left. It only costs $2.25 per person, a lot cheaper than Taxi or Uber. The bus has luggage rack and you get off on the 13th street stop and it is a short 5 minutes walk from there to the Hotel.","March 25, 2019","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

A Cuban restaurant is on the first floor adjacent to the lobby of the hotel. There is a large outdoor seating area as well for the restaurant in front of the hotel. Valet parking was great but $40/night. We tried to park in the garage one block away as suggested but it was full during our entire trip. The staff was peasant and fantastic. Everyone was helpful and courteous. EACH room has a cart with 4 towels, cooler, two beach chairs and a beach umbrella for your use on the beach. It was great having all this in the room and easy to pull out to the beach. Our room had a sink, plates, silverware, fridge, etc which was nice. The Cuban restaurant had great food as well.

587,"Review of Marriott’s Vacation Club Pulse Property in MiamiOur arrival was earlier than expected due to a snow storm in our hometown. Cici, at the front desk was very sweet and we felt very welcome upon arrival. Our room was ocean front on the 2nd floor. Although, I heard that being close to the street was not a good idea, it didn’t seem noisy at all when we checked in, which was around 12:30 in the afternoon. In the evening, there is a very low level of noise which stops around 11:00pm. It didn’t bother us at all. We were able to see the ocean, albeit through the palm trees, and it was stunning. There are very few ocean front rooms. Most people were happy with whatever they were given since it is such a special place. We did not have a stove nor pots to cook with. We had a microwave and very small refrigerator. They said we could have a hot plate and pots and pans if we wished, but we declined.In the morning from 7 am - 11 am, there is a continental breakfast in the lobby area for $5 a person. I heard the pastries come from an excellent bakery. We went down the block to Starbucks each day and sat outside at their tables. If we come again we will go to the News Cafe’ where the Cappuccinos are amazing. News Cafe was our favorite hang out. They don’t have the “hawkers” outside asking you to come in. They don’t need to. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced.One of the concierge’s we met named Tiffany was excellent. We did not go to the presentation since we had gone to 2 within the last year. I believe the presentations are given off site.We did wash clothes twice. It is in an area off the lobby with table, chairs, flat screen TV. We put it in the washer, set an alarm on our phones, then went to take our showers. Then, we would put another alarm on our phone when it was time to put the clothes in the dryer. You go to the front desk for the detergent. At 5pm there is a happy hour on the roof terrace where you are offered sangria, wine and beer. One drink complimentary. Any following drinks, only $3, which goes the the Children’s Network Charity. I would suggest going since we met some very nice people. Mimosa’s were offered in the lobby one day...on the weekends. We loved the Marriott Pulse Property and plan to return.Suggestions: *Many of the strip restaurants have an 18%-22% service charge applied plus 10% tax, so remember you don’t need to add an additional tip.*Go to visit the Lik Foundation Gallery and the National Geographic Gallery in the Lincoln Road Mall area. Our favorite Mexican food is there at Rosa Mexicana. Try the guacamole with hot chips. It is a lunch in itself.*Friday nights about 5pm, the Wolfson FIU Museum has a free docent led tour given by the librarian who has been there for 27 years. One of the best docent led tours we have been to.*Take an Uber and go have lunch at Le Zoo Restaurant at the upscale mall named Bal Harbor Mall while watching all of the fancy cars being valet parked. (Then peruse the mall where high end designers are all showcased. The Hillstone restaurant above Le Zoo is excellent but you won’t have a good view of the cars.*Don’t be lured in by the huge blue drinks with two beer bottles. They cost $40 each. Add the 22% service charge and the 10% tax and you are paying a lot for a drink. Their response is “Well, they are refillable!” You won’t see the cost of the drinks on any of the menus showcased outside. The breakfasts are reasonably priced, but then they charge $6.00 for an orange juice.*When walking down Ocean Drive, walk on the sidewalk across the street by the beach. You won’t be bothered by the “hawkers”.*There is NO sign indicating a Marriott Hotel when you pull up. The reason is the historical society wants to keep signage for only the original hotels, in order to preserve the wonderful Art Deco architecture. What you may see is a restaurant sign “Havana 1957”. As you walk in the front door of the building, to the left is the restaurant and to the right is the hotel.*Walk to the “Sandwicherie”. Best salads and sandwiches ever. Get them to go if you want. There are few stools to sit. It is really a stand more than a restaurant. If you wait a little, stools open up.","February 26, 2019","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

588,"I really can't imagine anyone giving this hotel a bad review. It is very modern, very clean, and very comfortable. There is a WONDERFUL rooftop terrace which was great for meeting with friends and watching the action of South Beach below. The hotel is also right across from the ocean. My room was on the 2nd floor...and I STILL had a great view of the ocean in the morning! The rooms had all the normal amenities that Marriott provides: comfortable beds and coffee maker (with coffee) being the more important amenities. Our room was a two-room suite since my two teenage kids joined my wife and I on a weekend trip to Miami Beach.There really isn't an on-site Marriott restaurant; but, the hotel is attached to Havana 1957. This restaurant was outstanding in every aspect. It was clean, fun, had live music, outdoor seating, a great menu, great location, and the service staff were exceptional. This is where we ate most of our meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.I can't say enough about the staff at Marriott Club Pulse...they were great. JC stepped up for us when we needed it; and, we're thankful for his help. I'd definitely stay at this hotel again.","February 22, 2019","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

589,"We reserved a ""studio"" and it was far more roomy than I expected. Nice decor in the room. Very quiet room (our room overlooked a central courtyard). Simple juice, tea, and coffee bar in the lobby each morning. Bikes (what we used to call ""strand cruisers,"" in CA) available. Laundry facilities on first floor and free detergent at front desk - had no trouble with availability of them and getting laundry done. Nice rooftop bar with 2 free drinks per person at happy hour every night. Downsides: a) No on-site parking (valet, or city garage parking about a block away which we opted for to save a little $). b) by overlooking the central courtyard (which is not anything special) we had no view which was fine with us but might not be your thing so choose your rooms accordingly c) It's nearly wall-to-wall restaurants along Ocean Drive and each one has a ""huckster"" trying to get you to look at the menu. You do have to walk through that each time you come and go, but I just found it to be ""local color.""

592,"The hotel was very nice and modern. In the middle of everything so in the right area, very buzzy and happening.I like the old building on the outside and modern fun on the inside. Rooms were very spacious, nice and renovated well.The only problem I had was cleaning. On the 2nd day, our room remained uncleaned (despite us telling the cleaning the she could clean as we were leaving). I called the hotel when we got back to the room in the night and they had someone come up and clean it.I also left a small bag on my bed that was empty on my bed the next day. When I got back to the room, my bed hadn’t been done. I was told that the cleaning employees do not clean the bed if something is left on it.I find this unreasonable as they could have simply moved it to the side and made the bed as no one wants to sleep on a dirty bed. However, after I called reception up, the called someone up to make it.Apart from the cleaning incidents, great hotel and service was good.

593,"We enjoyed this Marriott Vacation Club location very much. It is our first time trying The Pulse property and this location is fantastic. The Miami South Beach is just across the road, a 3 minute walk to sun and fun.We had a King size bedroom which also has a sofa bed. Clean and comfortable. There is a small kitchenette equipped with a toaster, coffee maker, microwave oven and a refrigerator. Our room was on the 5th floor (highest floor) and there is also an open terrace on this floor whereby you can enjoy fresh air and sun. A very light complimentary breakfast was also offered either on the grpund floor lobby or the 5th floor terrace (depending on the weather). We had a nice chat with William Sharp (I think that is his name) during breakfast one morning and he was very attentive to all the guests and was very helpful too.There are also washers and dryers located at the back of the first floor. And there is also a beach stroller in our room, equipped with beach towels, 2 foldable beach chairs, umbrella and a cooler for your cold drinks. Just push the stroller out with you to the beach. What a nice touch! Overall, a very good experience for us (stayed 3 nights), highly recommended!P.S. If you are driving there, besides the valet parking ($42.80) offered by The Pulse, you can also part at the multi-storey public car park (covered) at the corner of 13th Street and Collins Ave - called 13th Street Garage (G3). Charges by the hour but we paid $20 for parking 15+ hours each day. Maximum is $20 per day and this is just 5 minutes' walk to The Pulse.","December 23, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

595,"I am just going to list the bad things, after the two good things. The good things:1) the staff is more friendly than I remember encountering at other hotels. Especially the Manager (or manager in training?).2) they serve 2 free drinks each evening on the rooftop (5th floor).The bad:1) no decaf coffee served in the morning in the lobby. They only put out a thermos of regular coffee, a carafe of orange juice, and a carafe of apple juice. Granted this is more than some Marriotts, but if putting out a thermos of regular, then put out a thermos of decaf. I did ask about this, and they asked if I'd be there the next morning. I told them I'd be there the next couple mornings. Well no thermos next day or any day of decaf. Coffee starts at 7am. Guess what time they are mopping the floor EVERY morning that is the only way to the coffee from the elevators. Yep, 7am. And at 7:20am still doing it. Seems the night guy can do this or some other time.2) The old name (Edgewater) is still on the sidewalk where you walk into the hotel. Maybe they just bought the place? I know that my super shuttle reservation had problems due to my telling them it was the Marriott Pulse, but their records showed Edgewater.3) The restaurant attached to the hotel (Havana 1957) is not good and ADDS A 2% RESORT FEE to all diner's meals. I feel they should tell you this upfront. This means if you walk by, decide to eat there, that you will be charged a 2% resort fee without being forewarned. And the food was not good anyways. You might want to see my review that I did on the restaurant. Plus the employees of the restaurant can be right next to the door that you go in to the hotel, your hands full of luggage and they don't even help with the door. If they are going to charge a resort fee to eat there, as if we are sleeping overnight in the restaurant, then they can grab a door if you can't. 4) the bed was hard as a rock, it really hurt my back. Felt like sleeping on a sheet that was on the carpeted floor. I had them make up the pull out sofa bed and I slept on that the remaining nights. 5) The bathroom has been redone but: the shower... you cannot get in easily without getting wet the way the door opens into the water stream. So reach your hand in and make sure that it is the right temp, as you will definitely get wet when you enter the shower. Also the water goes cold, warm, hot, cold hot, cold.... throughout the shower. There is only a soap dish. No where to put the shampoo or conditioner that they supply. So for an old guy like me it is difficult to reach up and down from the ground to get and put back the shampoo. Even harder for my older better half who is 81.There is no place to put many items (toiletries) around the sink. But this is strange as there is plenty of space for them to put like a 2 foot wide, 1 foot deep table to put items. This huge open space is where the bathroom plug is, so if you want to charge your electric razor in the bathroom, it has to hang there and somehow stay plugged. There is only one hook for a used towel in the bathroom. I mean come on! Not even a standard double hook on the back of the door? There are 2 people in the room. 6) the furniture should be rearranged. They had the tv in the middle of the room facing a large armoire. The couch on the left wall, the bed on the right. They should put the couch where the armoire was, and the armoire where the couch was. As it was, due to the couch placement, you had to sit in the one corner of it to sort of see the tv. That corner cushion was worn out. the other half of the couch was never used so it was very firm.7) The coffee table looked old and like it didn't match. 8) no freezer shelf in the mini fridge so the miniature ice creams we bought had to be eaten or thrown out. I thought all mini fridges top shelfs were freezer shelfs? Nope I was wrong. 9) thermostat: you need to press the ""up"" and ""down"" arrows more than a couple times before it registers once. It is worn out and old. Time to replace them.10) the items that they give you when they give you your room key says that there is coffee served on the rooftop terrace each morning. It is NOT. There is more (safe is only inches from the floor - hard for older guests, no fan in bathroom, etc...), but just not the Marriott quality we are accustomed to. Would have given it one star but the people that work there are so super friendly that had to give it 2 stars. But would not stay here again.","December 9, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

We previously had stayed on the other side of Miami at the Biscayne Bay and found that we had to do a lot of driving if we wanted to see the beach area. I came across this hotel while trying to price the trip. I was a little skeptic. This place was well worth it plus some! From the first moment we arrived, everything was just awesome. We were greeted by the front desk and given all the info we needed to maneuver throughout the hotel. The best part was we were directly across the street from the beach! As a bonus in the room was a beach cart which allowed us to wheel the cart down to the beach. It contained chairs and an umbrella.

Easy option is to go for public parking which is walking distance form the hotel.Drawback: steet side is bit noisy at night. Also, they do not provide breakfast.

A big thank you to Brittany, Edward, Kayla, Emmanuel and so many others which I forgot to get their names.

Though there was construction in the hotel, it didn’t bother us because we were not in the rooms in the day. Everyone is super friendly and makes your stay extra special. We loved the complimentary happy hour. The upstairs patio has a gorgeous view of the ocean. Perfect for sunsets. Also, there was a nice selection of coffee, teas and juices in the morning. The beach cart was our favorite amenity in the room. Very convenient, it has everything that you need for a day at the beach, even a cooler. I could go on and on about this property and how fabulous it was. It’s in close proximity to bars, restaurants. Two of my favorite spots were, La Sandwicheria and Charlotte’s bakery for empanadas which is in walking distance from the hotel. The beach and beautiful Lumus Park are right across the street.

Definitely recommend this one!","July 27, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

604,"We used to go to this hotel before Marriott bought it and it definitely had a intimate feel to it. Now that it's the Marriott, it is more stylish and spacious and we loved the new rooms. However, like with most big hotels we lost the attention that you get with smaller ones. No one cared that we were there for our 3-year anniversary and while we certainly didn't expect anything special, a congratulations or smile would have been nice. Furthermore, something that really bothered us is that there is always someone in the lobby who is trying to sell you the Marriott Vacation Club membership. If you've been to South Beach, you know that walking up and down the main road you are bombarded with people trying to get you into their restaurant. It is a relief to finally make it to your hotel lobby where you can feel relaxed. However, at this hotel it's not like that. After going out for dinner we didn't arrive back until 10 at night and there was still someone in the lobby who was trying to get us to go to a presentation. It was a very pushy sales pitch and we really didn't like that because we just wanted to go to our room. The hotel should be safe space where things like that don't happen. Also the walls are very thin and we were able to hear our neighbors talk about what they needed to pack in which suitcase the whole night. Once they realize that they could hear us they were quiet. But it's just a heads up that you can easily here your neighbors in this hotel.","July 18, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

606,"As a Marriott Platinum Elite member for the last 10 years i do appreciate the excellent service received at most Marriotts. That can not be said at this property. One employee by the name of JC was the most arrogant, obnoxious and unprofessional employee I have encountered in 10 years at a Marriott. So unfortunate the entire brand is tarnished by such an employee. As long as this fellow is employed I suggest staying next door at the Winter Haven also a Marriott property.","July 7, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

607,"After getting off the Carnival ship at 8:30 a.m., we had no place to go but our hotel in Miami Beach. The staff at the Marriott Pulse let us know that we were very early for check in. Four days on a cruise and my nieces just wanted to sleep. They napped in the lobby for a bit and then we went off to eat lunch and to the beach across the street. During this whole time, we were very grumbly and the front desk staff kept checking with housekeeping to assure us we would check in as soon as the room was ready. Hats off to Ednie, the front desk manager. As soon as the room was ready, she came all the way to the beach to find us. (I couldn't hear my cell phone). And when we got to the room, what was on the kitchen counter? Only my favorite bottle of wine. I don't know how Ednie knew, but she worked miracles for us. Beautiful hotel, excellent staff, and fun Cuban restaurant right next door. Thanks for everything, Ednie!!!","June 11, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

608,"My wife and I had a very pleasant stay at this property. Hotel staff was responsive from check in to check out. Bravo for having beach carts in every room. Speaking of room...ours was very sizable...more akin to a studio apartment. No complaints about the bed. It was very comfortable. The hotel's location can't be beat! It's directly across the street from the beach and just a five minute walk to the Lincoln Road Outdoor Mall. The property doesn't have a pool, but it does have a pleasant rooftop which serves happy-hour drinks daily. The hotel lobby has a modern, chic vibe to it that we really enjoyed. There are certainly tons of options on Miami Beach, but I highly recommend Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel right at home which cannot always be said even for some of the higher end properties.","June 9, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

609,"Can’t beat this location! Gorgeous views and right on beach. Every staff member we met was super accommodating and friendly. They went out of their way for our large group of 10 ladies while on my Bachelorette trip. Shout out to JC (Juan Carlo), Christian, James, and maid service who took care of us every day and went the extra mile. They were all very knowledgeable and great at giving recommendations for local hot spots. Our maid even supplied us with a nice card and bottle of wine to congratulate me! We had a great time each night taking advantage of their free happy hour on the rooftop from 5-6 (I believe) every night with gorgeous views! The beach buggy (with chairs and cooler) was super helpful and convenient to wheel your belongings down to the beach. The Cuban restaurant below the hotel also had great food and service! The only negative was where our rooms were located, facing the ally full of restaurant dumpsters. We knew we weren’t getting a view, however the smell of baking trash in the Miami heat prevented us from utilizing our terrace. The worst part was trash got picked up every morning (including Sunday’s) at 7am sharp. The truck was incredibly loud (not just from maneuvering the dumpsters, but also from the constant reverse signal beeping and men yelling directions to the driver in the tight ally) for about 20 minutes. It interrupted our sleep every morning and was incredibly frustrating. When we complained about it to the hotel, they tried accommodating us by calling the trash company and offering to move all of our rooms. Overall, we loved staying here and will be back again!","May 24, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

There are several personal alcoves you can sit in with plugs and USB ports. They have a happy hours that provides 2 complimentary drinks a day. They have a mini store in the lobby as well. Towards the back of the lobby are 2 washer and dryers for us and a tv to watch while you wait. There are many restaurants along the street to pick from.Was in room 314 with windows to a courtyard. The room is close to the elevator and the halls do echo a bit but not really a complaint. The room has a coffee maker, dishes, microwave, small refrigerator and tons of counter space. The closet has a safe that is great for laptops and such. In the cornet of the room is a cart you can use that is self contained with umbrella, towels and all you would need for the beach.The night stand has a clock with multiple USB ports available.

The rooftop sun deck is nice with a great view. Our room was ok. It had an interior courtyard view. Which means no view. I paid full price and I am a loyal Marriott rewards member. The room location could have been better, and I should not have to beg for it. The staff were all very nice, and there is a fun bar/ restaurant onsite. The two drawbacks are no pool, and some of the rooms have little to no view. The location and proximity to the beach is great.

614,"We went to Miami for 3 days before a 7 day cruise and then another 3 days in Miami. We stayed at this Marriott Vacation Club Pulse property the last 3 days of our vacation. It is a perfect location in Miami Beach. It is situated on Ocean Ave., just beyond the 14th st. intersection. It is a short walk across the street to the ocean and only 1 block away is Collins Ave. It is near all the hot spots in Miami Beach -- restaurants, boutique shops, art, and more. We had a studio with a king-sized bed and a kitchenette. We did not cook because we were there only 3 days but it certainly was adequate. There was a half-sized burner and a decent-sized refrigerator. The bathroom was very adequate with a great shower. The staff at this property is superior. In particular, we were greeted by Emmanuel who is a jolly guy who loves to help people. At the end of our visit we met William Sharp who is the Operations Manager and he answered many questions about the property. Very nice guy! You must try Le Sandwicheria for one of your meals. It is located around the corner on 14th between Collins and Washington. We went and got delicious salads (very fresh vegetables) for dinner and delicious Croissants filled with eggs, bacon and cheese for breakfast. Coffee is great as was the OJ. You can sit at the counter outside and eat or order it to take out. The staff is very friendly here and it is much cheaper than eating at a restaurant.","April 3, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

620,"Arrived last August after a long flight to check in for 1 night for the Coldplay concert. Arrived around 6pm to basically shower, change and head out.The front desk staff gave me a keycard, and i went to my room but it didnt work. Headed back downstairs for another keycard and repeated the whole dance again and it still didnt work. So I went downstairs for the third time for them to tell me its probably something wrong with the door and the system needs to be ""reset"" However the guy who can do it isnt here and should be back in 30 mins. I asked for another room but ""they cant do that."" So i sit and wait, eventually the guy arrives and I follow him up to the room. It takes another 20-30 min to unlock the door. I'm sitting on the floor just applying makeup and trying to make the best of a bad situation. At this point a shower is out of the question, im already late and I just drop my bags so I can search my phone for an Uber. My phone won't connect. The wifi's out. I call downstairs and they confirm this, even though Im paying for wifi in this package. They tell me there's no one to fix it until tomorrow. So I literally run across to the restaurant next door to connect to their wifi so I can uber to the concert that i'm late for. I didn't like the treatment at this hotel. I repeatedly questioned why I was paying for this terrible experience.

Emanuel was one of the best ambassadors a hotel could ask for. He was at our service from the start. Great change from customer NO service in most places. The hotel is fresh and clean. Rooms were very clean. Bed was not the most comfortable but was not bad. Noise was somewhat normal for a hotel. Not obnoxious, but a we did hear our neighbors and noise from the hall corridor occasionally. Not a deal killer. Noise from the restaurant just below our window was not bad either.The room was outfitted with a beach cart that had two beach chairs and an umbrella. Even though we felt like the Griswold's going to the beach the first time, it was awesome. People even asked us where we got it and we were pleased to say that it came with our room.The room also had a small fridge with an icebox. Not huge but larger than most other hotel mini fridges. TV was large and adequate, didn't watch it very much at all honestly. There was a free rooftop reception/cocktail party each day on the roof but we did not attend, no idea how nice it was. We did enjoy the restaurant downstairs though. Very good service there too.All in all a great trip and a wonderful stay at this hotel.

Although there was a restaurant at the hotel it was independent and I believe it would have been better had it been a part of the hotel.We ate out every night that week and there was always a great place to try within walking distance. Having the beach and boardwalk right across the street really helped keep the pounds off as we could run every morning without a large crowd.If we go back that far south I'm certain we will stay there again.","January 5, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

624,"My wife and I stayed here while getting ready to depart for a cruise and to recover from the same cruise afterwards. First thing to note, it is a boutique hotel so if you have expectations of some massive hotel from the Marriott chain, this isn't it. We really enjoyed the hotel's location, decor and amenities provided. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would like to provide recognition for J.C. Jimenez, who went out of his way to ensure we were well taken care of. In each room there is a cart with beach chair, towels and an umbrella for walking across the street and setting up shop on the beach. People around us were asking about it and raved as their hotels didn't provide this service. The hotel's location made it easy to walk to several locations along South Beach, Mid-Beach and other various destinations. Otherwise, everything interesting in the area is easily traveled to via Uber. Given the opportunity we would definitely stay here again and think it is a perfect place for someone looking to stay in South Beach. When looking at this property and deciding on a room you should definitely request the rooms that are situated along Ocean Drive, otherwise the views from the other rooms are lacking. 5th floor Ocean front, or the front side 1 bedroom villas are best.","January 5, 2018","10    Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, South Beach

635,When we first arrived everything seemed great! Till we realized that there isn’t a lot of diversity in people as far as color. Didn’t really bother us until we got to the rooftop pool. Where we were ignored by waiters/waitresses and looked at like we didn’t belong! One couple moved away from us in disgust once we entered the POOL! The waiter JORDYN was suppose to help us but he was too busy ignoring us and DANCING IN THE CABANAS with other guest ( White) . This was the worst experience ever! To make matters WORST I asked a concierge for access to the house car and he turns and looks at me and says ARE YOU EVEN A GUEST HERE! Like really dude why would I ask about a house car if I wasn’t a guest. Me and my family were great with others in the hotel lower pool area and beach. But the rooftop is definitely RACIST! Our suite was beautiful and house keeping was great! But if you’re a BLACK PERSON I wouldn’t recommend this place at ALL!,"July 10, 2019","11    1 Hotel South Beach

638,"We paid extra to have a room with a balcony however that balcony was useless, looking at ACs and construction workers.The room itself was nice and spacious, with beautiful bathroom and comfortable bed. I loved minimalist, modern design and white color everywhere but some more attention to details could make the room perfect. I would add internet cable, some more details on the walls, etc. but that is only my personal preference.When it comes to our stay, guys at the beach are so hardworking and helpful, they really made our stay. I have to mention amazing in room service, very fast delivery each time and food was great. The delivery guys were truly amazing too.The rest of the staff members weren`t as kind and helpful.We had issue with our shower that we reported and it was never fixed.We also had issues with our bill that hopefully will be fixed.Hotel has a cool app that you can use to request any service or check out.Overall, convenient location, modern, beautiful design, good food but staff needs a little bit more training so the whole experience could be 5*.","July 9, 2019","11    1 Hotel South Beach

However I would like to point out one small issue which I felt while we were being checked in not just with the person who checked us in but an overall experience with the staff members I got in touch with;The staff I felt are very up tight very cold lacking personality which doesn’t match with the design and concept of the hotel itself.I have been an hotel manager and have hospitality experience of over 10 years working in Australia, so when I stay in hotel I see through it all.

646,"As soon as you walk into the lobby you feel zen. It smells like a spa and the lounge chairs and couches are in this oatmeal color that makes you want to sit and not get up. The check-in was super easy. The key way made out of recycle wood. So cool. The entire hotel really lives up to its motto of sustainability and eco friendly. Now for the room, it’s just phenomenal. I never wanted to leave it. You walk in and to your right is the bathroom that has a Jacuzzi tub and a separate shower and 2 sinks. Just so modern and clean. On the jacuzzi was basically a huge window that looked right into the room. It freaked me out for a second but there is a curtain that you can close for privacy. Now the bed was elevated and the king size bed was beyond comfy. The bedding was so luxurious. And then you have a huge separate sitting area with a couch that was a L shaped. The tv was this huge 55 inch flat screen. I was sad to leave it every morning. I just wanted to lay in the bed all day. Now for the pools. The third floor is where the main pool. I liked all the comfy lounge chairs. And the Sand Box restaurant was right there. The only thing is that there’s a lot of families with small kids. It can get too crowded. Right below is a long swimming pool which can have less people but another place to lounge and swim. And then there a huge lap pool where there’s less people and great to do laps.We ate at Sand Box twice for lunch and the food is really good. Had a lot of options. Btw-their wings were delicious. And our servers were quick and friendly. Finally the all adult rooftop pool is amazing. We were there Saturday and there’s a DJ that places really good music. We were told to come early otherwise there will be no place to lounge. Our servers were really friendly and provide great service. The best unexpected surprise was the use of the hotel car: it’s a Tesla SUV. Omg!! It will take you for no charge within 3 miles. We took it twice and it was such a nice experience.The entire experience was amazing. From the friendly staff who always asks us how is everything to answering our questions and making sure our stay was perfect. This is our new favorite hotel. Definitely coming back.

651,"Brilliant stay, 5 nights for Le Miami.It’s a big 426-room resort yet they manage to make it personalized.The whole concept is executed beautifully and immediately puts you in Zen mode with rustic-edged wooden tables, gold coral sea fans printed on the walls and reclaimed Colorado beetle kill pine wood, naturally dyed a cornflower blue colour.Beds are plush and pretty, on raised platforms so they appear to float.Also the bathrooms are equally inviting and oversized with Calacatta marble soaking tubs, rainfall showers with peek-a-boo windows and trough sinks. Not all rooms had the balcony that I booked but very many do, and an ocean-facing room is far superior to the city view, I saved on $ and booked the road view :-(The staff are extremely well trained, competent and professionally friendly without being servile . In order to lower their carbon footprint, they’ve replaced paper brochures with a 1 Hotels Field Guide app, allowing for customisation in everything from room temperature to in-room dining. The water faucet is also a nice addition.In addition to the multiple swimming pools, there’s also a spa, salon, and boot camp-style gym. The ground level is home to a handful of luxury boutiques a lovely lounge with great live music and a Soul Cycle spinning studio. The gym and F&B outlet is terrific. This brand will do well.Do yourself a favour and stay here it’s much better than Nautilus where I stayed last year.","June 26, 2019","11    1 Hotel South Beach

They even sell candles so you can experience the smell at home! Some cons to the hotel is that the snacks in the snack bar were outdated and between the few pools they have on site lounge chairs still fill up. Get there early! Although, the beach staff try and accommodate you the in the best way they can. Service at the pool can be turned up a notch. We were at the rooftop pool and I pressed the service button on the lounge chair( a few times) to only find out our server didn't have her bracelet on to be alerted. I was confused by that to say the least. While at the center pool it took a while for a server to even greet us. I had to go up the bar myself and ask for someone to come over.

684,"I’ve had my eyes on this hotel for years so I was really excited to finally get an opportunity to stay here. I was here less than 24 hours because I was overnighting in Miami Beach before continuing onto Brazil. It’s a boutique hotel with only about 79 rooms which are all suites. My room was beautifully appointed and even had a wet bar with bar stools. There was an entertainment tower with flat screen tv’s on both sides; one facing the bed and the other facing the Living area. I’ve never seen a bathroom area so spacious; I’d call it a bathroom suite. It has three parts that can be closed off by frosted glass panels: a separate vanity, toilet, another vanity outside of the shower. The shower had four fixed sprays, an overhead rain showerhead, a removable showerhead and a built-in bench. The shower was a wonderful/relaxing experience. I’d definitely stay here again. Be sure to inquire about the daily incidental charge to be frozen on your credit card and any other charges so that you’ll be prepared. The location is just a few blocks from the Lincoln Road Pedestrian Mall in South Beach. Thanks Kate for your assistance!","July 12, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

Not to mention you can get service from the front porch poolside. This day included beach chairs and champagne upon arrival.

We checked out two days later and the filthy water was still left in it. No one came to empty it or clean it. The breakfast was in a restaurant attached but separate. All the sell is eggs done in any way you can imagine but eggs is about it. Oh or pancakes. No good for someone who can’t have eggs.

It was never going to work. The trainee at reception was fantastic but there’s where it ends. We went to our room which wasn’t the room that I booked. Came out for dinner to meet a party in one room down the corridor and a screaming argument in another. Complained to the manager and the man couldn’t even be civil to me or look me in the eye. I then discovered at our next sop the next night I’d left my pyjamas there. 2 emails with no reply and then an international phone call to find out there’s nothing in there log.

Move the furniture, sweep under the tables, deep clean cushions. I noticed that most guests sit on them in bikinis, bathing suits or very thin or netted beach cover ups.This is very unsanitary if they are not disinfected or cleaned regularly. This is something to seriously consider as it is a very high traffic lobby and patio area. The rooms just need some touch up painting of walls, frames and doors in certain areas.Otherwise I would definitely return I loved my room.","May 18, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

698,"I have stayed at Z Ocean many years in a row. The place was always beautiful. The location could not be better. The service was impeccable. Well.....things have drastically changed. Because I am an IHG member and a repeat customer I have gotten to know many employees and they have gotten to know or recognize me. There were pluses with this stay. On arrival I was sent a beautiful bottle of champagne. A very nice surprise. I booked two rooms for three nights each. I was able to get the rooms I requested. One of which was even a complimentary early check in. Breakfast at the Front Porch Cafe was excellant as always. The beach staff as always were pleasant and personable. Unfortunately the water was really rough and needed to spend time at the pool as swimmung was pretty unsafe due to rip tides. That happens. Let me start by saying I did have issues with my original reservations. After over 90 minutes on the phone w/ reservations I just cancelled and rebooked my stay. I also found it odd a bellman answered one of my calls. Were they that short staffed? Well.....understatement. The rooms are still gorgeous and the location remains optimal. However service has changed. Really changed!! Let me explain what we noticed. The bellman who used to meet you at the curb was not there. Thentootries in the rooms were.not replenishsed. Many of the pool chairs were torn. The hot tub did not work and rarely was filled. The pool deck always looked like it needed a sweep. There was garbage in the hot tub and the pool could have used a skim....every day. Typically there is a pool bar and attendant. The attendant makes rounds, gets drinks and food. Well....day 1 no attenedant. Day two attendant took 45 minutes for two cocktails that were horrible. Sent back because they were so bad....yet no comp drinks and still charged despite our concerns. We then got our own drinks. It was right down the stairs. It was faster. We knew the drinks would be right. Its just too bad. They could have made a lot more money if they were more on top of it!!! No pool towels. Had to ask for them every day. In fact I picked up dirty dishes and empty cups poolside that had been there since the day before, called down stairs and had them picked up. I also pulled old towels from the day before off chairs too. Ok.....room tidy. I asked three times to have the sleeper sofa made up in one room. On the way to dinnner on the first night request number 4. Pleaae make up roll away. No worries.....i called after dinner when i got back as well. So after 6 requests....it was made up. The next day when we left for breakfast and shopping we put the make up thenroom sign on. Well not done. Back mid afternoon....sign still on...room still not made up. So when we left we asked. We were assured it wpuld be made up. It was. At 11 PM a knock on the door....the towels we requested....except we didnt. Our friends did. They had no tpwelsmin the room called at 1015 when we fot back for towels. We sentnthem to that room. Wait 45 minutes for towels? The towels should have been there when the room was made up. This became a daily experience. There was always a line at the desk. Which used to be staffed with two people....but now only staffed with one. The regualr housekeepers I knew were no where around. Some of my makeup was missing. This was a first! I was disappointed. Such a great hotel whos service is now in the toilet. I spoke with the manager. Thenmanager was understanding and kind. Was not aware of some issues and aware of others. Apology accepted.....however we spent a significant amount of money to stay there....and the service was that of a budget hotel. In SOBE hotels are a dime a dozen and for this money you could stay at any number of places. As an IHG member I expect a certain level of service. It is no longer. No more free water daily. No more cleaning up the balcony. Staff is so slim includung the front desk. I feel sad because I loved staying here. Im not sure ill be back next year.

The next day they got us in the correct room and gave us a free night. Other than poor communication the service was good and friendly! They initial told me they would give me a few free nights.

710,"This hotel was exceptional. The staff were excellent, so friendly and helpful. The valet, Lewis, was extremely helpful in keeping our luggage so we could take a trolley around town and even had a taxi waiting on us to take us to our cruiseship after our tour. The room was great--so comfortable and modern. Its location was excellent, right where all the restaurants and activity was taking place. We ate in the restaurant on site, The Front Porch, and the food was delicious. A very busy bar was semi-outside (covered) so you could see the people walking up and down the street. We enjoyed our short stay immensely.","March 4, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

711,"I booked my stay at this hotel specifically because of the bathroom, beach, and pool. When I was showering , I moved the top left nozzle shower head to aim towards me, as I did with the rest of them. That nozzle fell off and hit my foot, which was painful. I picked it up and placed it back into the wall, although that should have never happened at all. As I stood in there attempting to enjoy my shower, it became flooded due to the drainage working improperly. This caused me to end my shower shortly after. It was an extreme disappointment. Not only that, but the pool wasn't even available for use. When I booked the room, it did not state anywhere that the pool was not available. Even though the pool was available for my use next door, it's unacceptable. I wanted to use the pool at the Z hotel, not the neighboring hotel. Again, the pool is partly why I booked my stay there. That being said, I am not satisfied with my stay. I will rate it a 1. Note- the check in experience was absolutely horrible!","March 3, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

713,"We stayed two nights here at the start of a road trip around Southern Florida, we thought that the location was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Being IHG members we were given a free drink on arrival and a complimentary bottle of wine to take to the room which was very nice. The room itself was one of the penthouse suites with rooftop terrace and jacuzzi, it had partial view of the sea but mainly other hotels and to be honest we didn't have enough time to really take advantage of this facility but it would be excellent for guests with more time to spare.The pool was closed, a fact we weren't made aware of before arriving, however, there was the use of a neighbouring hotel pool and to be fair, we didn't have time anyway so not really an issue for us. The breakfast was excellent and we were well placed for all of South Beach.The only criticism we would have is that there were dirty cups and glasses outside of our room when we arrived and they were still there when we left two days later, the general public areas could have done with updating and better cleaning.","February 21, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

721,"We moved into a hotel owned condo from a private owned condo partway through our stay and the difference in standards and service was astounding. The condo was very clean and comfortable with nice extra touches, the staff were hugely helpful even offering to move our luggage from one room to theirs. It's in a very very good location for the beach, art deco buildings and very good restaurants as well as supermarkets within a few minutes walk. As their swimming pool has been closed by the owners they have an arrangement with the Betsy next door and even provide towels. They also have a private area of the beach with towels and sunbeds provided which is a nice touch. Room service can be hard to get hold of but when it arrives it's good. The staff though are one of the best things, the people on reception and the cleaner we met were so lovely it totally turned our trip around after a truly horrendous initial stay with the private owners.

I am not sure how to describe the gym other than to say, they should just remove it and send guests elsewhere. It is pathetic.

726,"We were at the Z Ocean 5 years ago, but it has declined since then. On the plus side, the location is excellent, just off of Ocean Drive and the beach. The suites, (there are many of them) are set up like a small apartment. They come with a small fridge, espresso machine, sink, and assorted glassware and dishes. There are also two T.Vs (one in the small living area and one in the bedroom). The large bathroom is separate from the shower room (which also has a sink). The bedroom area had a very comfortable king bed and good storage/closet space. The problems involve the room's outside deck and private upper deck (reached by a spiral staircase) that has a large, private whirlpool tub. The walls of the deck area need work, many of the furnishings and outside bar entertainment units are worn or rusting, and the tile floors look grungy. Also, the hotel's hall carpeting looks dirty. Other issues are the lack of hotel amenities. While there is a very small gym and a small pool, the only other public space other than the lobby is a covered outside area with a bar that always seems to be empty. The bar is located off the lobby next to a restaurant called The Front Porch (open for B,L and D) Although we were disappointed in the restaurant 5 years ago we tried it again, - still not good. Fortunately there are many good restaurants nearby. Parts of the hotel have been turned into condo units, and this might have something to do with the lack of attention being given to the hotel rooms. All that said, the hotel staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating.","January 20, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

All the staff we interacted with treated us like friends and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The location is top notch just across the street from the boardwalk and beach.

730,"Pros: hotel is in an ideal location for walking to the beach and has beach towels, chairs and umbrellas that come with your stay. We were there for The seafood festival and the walking distance was perfect. The restaurant downstairs is not associated with the hotel so you can’t charge anything to the room but the breakfast is good and not expensive. Cons: I mentioned the biting bugs in the room, they asked me to send pictures, so i did and never heard back. The staff is not very informative or helpful e.g no one bothered to mention how to use the card key to access the elevator, so it takes a few minutes to figure it out because there is also no signage. The signage to locate the pool area are difficult to decipher so it takes a few minutes to actually locate the pool area. No one was there to provide a towel for the pool. The pool is located in what appears to be an inner court yard and is cozy, if I’m being politically correct. Had friends over for the festival asked if they could charge my room for parking, front desk said yes, parking attendants said no. The room itself has a bathroom layout that was difficult for me to traverse e.g there were buttons and dials with no signage so you did not know what was going to happen when you turned or pressed.","December 28, 2018","12    Crowne Plaza South Beach - Z Ocean Hotel

735,"We really enjoyed our stay. The only reason we gave 4 not 5 stars is that we were not told in advance that the Pool as well as the main entrance were both under renovations. While I know this info would NOT have deterred me from staying it would have helped with activity planning and ease of access for my wife. She recently hand foot surgery and navigating around the hotel would not have thrown us off. Your other saving grace is DEFINITELY your Front Desk agent EXTRAORDINAIRE Jeannette! As I’am an Platinum Ambassador level member of their hotel program ( IHG Rewards )and did not even have to mention that. She greeted us as though we have stayed there before! She is a star!!! I believe you have an Employee recognition program, she should get the honor. Also the Bellman Juan at check-in and I forgot his name but the Bellman upon checkout ( Nov. 19th morning before 10am ) he was so nice and accommodating we wanted to adopt him and take him on the Cruise with us....SMILES! We truly felt like family!I will definitely return.The other slight issue was the length of time it took to get our Jacuzzi ready. We were told 30 minutes, but took more closer to 1 hr. But once it was ready it was awesome. We had the Penthouse Suite with Jacuzzi, which made the suite a duplex! You go out to your Balcony and up the winding stairs to the next floor and the space has a mini fridge, Jacuzzi, and lounge area.

736,"Awful- we arrived late Friday and had to squeeze past 2 huge trash containers and ushered up some back entrance thru the back office to the reception- no explanation given to this and I had to ask if there was any reason for maneuvering round trash containers and was told the hotel was going thru renovations - first impressions not good . We were offered a glass of sparkling wine in plastic dollar store glasses - an actual glass would have been nicer considering the so called standard of the hotel . We were told that our booking had breakfast for two but did not include our children - Even though we were told it was included , she recommended that we did not orglder the buffet for them but order alcarte - proably just as well as there was no buffet offered .. strange she did not know this- We had booked the ocean view jacuzzi room and asked for the jacuzzi to be set up so our children could use it along with the pull out sofa to be made up . During this time the receptionist had not said please , good evening thank you... we got to our room and went to see the jacuzzi that was being filled up and saw that it was filthy ... two old used dirty towels were on one of the loungers - we went back to the reception and showed the pictures of the filthy jacuzzi and an extremely nice helpful gentleman began to help us and acknowledged our frustrations . We decided to go back to the room and sort the situation out in the morning . The kids pull out had been made with a sheet and light blanket and spent the night uncomfortable and freezing . We went back to the reception the next morning to sort the situation out ... after a lot of back and fourth and no resolution we had the option to move to another room which we said we would not use the jacuzzi as the one we saw was filthy we were given an option at regular price for a room with no jacuzzi - the only room avalable at that time was an inside view of the pool but it had no water in it as it was been renovated- what ??? For the price being charged I think we paid almost $500 for the night we now have no pool ??? I was told but other guests don’t mind .... we checked out that very minute - so much for our 6 day ocean view ( if you really squint) jacuzzi suite . We are platinum ihg members and I have never received see such run down conditions, lack of customer services .

Room was clean, with an excellent bed for good rest! We stayed in an Ocean view room and the view was spectacular! Really Loved all the Exotic flowers and plants outside. It was a bit pricey, but we will most definitely stay here again.","June 22, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

744,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Our flight arrived in Miami before 10:00 am. We took a cab to the hotel thinking we would stow our luggage, visit the beach and come back at regular check in time. We received a very warm welcome from Marie, the front desk manager. Not only did she offer us an early check in but also a complementary upgrade. She guaranteed us a late check-out because our flight the next day wasn't until evening. Marie also offered us assistance with our bags and told us she would be available if we needed anything else.We quickly learned that the entire staff (and this is a very well staffed hotel) was warm and friendly and always available to assist.We've traveled a lot and can honestly say that the staff at this hotel was the most consistently friendly and accommodating.The room was gorgeous! It was immaculately clean, the decor was fresh and updated, the balcony was large and overlooked the pool and ocean, and all the amenities you could think of were provided.The pool area was lovely with a multitude of seating options, a tiki bar, cabanas, palm trees galore, high top tables for dining, a gazebo for relaxing, a towel station for guests with infused water at the ready, easy access to the beach, and showers. On the beach the hotel provides lounge chairs with umbrellas, bar service, a play area for children and lots of clean sand.We had dinner in the hotel restaurant that was reasonably priced for the area, with a variety of choices, very good service, and delicious food. The atmosphere was very tropical and relaxing. We had the option to eat inside or out on a very elegant patio that overlooked the pool.The hotel grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained. There's a mini gazebo with exotic birds, winding pathways through palm trees, three separate areas set up for sunbathing...The hotel also offers a gym, gift shop, large and comfortable foyer, piano bar... I'm sure there was more but we didn't have time to see it all.It really was one of the nicest stays we've had in a hotel. I would highly recommend the Palms Hotel to anyone visiting Miami.","June 20, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

A supermarket and a gift shop are also nearby. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant is really good. However, the lady in the restaurant reception is not so welcoming compared to other staff. Staff was so friendly and helpful. Especially the front desk staff is so helpful and kind.

Every chance we get, this is our hotel of choice when in town. Our daughter recently got married in Key West and my husband and I had to spend a couple of days here to relax before the big event. Friendly, professional staff with everything you need to enjoy either the lush pool environment or cozy beach chair service. Very nice place to enjoy a glass of wine with lunch by the pool. Great beach towels. Did I mention the ocean view or privacy of the hotel compound? Or the parrots? It has been remodeled or redecorated several times over these years.

752,"We spent a week at this beautiful hotel for the second year in a row. It was just as fabulous as last year - I don't think I'll ever try another hotel on Miami Beach. I saw many of the same staff members from the previous year, which tells me much about good management. I became a regular at the Essensia Restaurant while my husband attended a conference, and Noemi took great care of me every day. Our room was very comfortable and the front desk was able to check us in early again this year. Patricia Torres and staff kept our room spotless and Patricia even patiently let me practice my Spanish greetings each day. She's a great teacher! I could gush more about this hotel (pool, tiki hut service and staff, boardwalk, beach cabanas, location on Miami Beach, wonderful hotel stewards who greeted us every time we returned from dinner out), but I'll save it for a 2nd review about The Spa and Bobbi and Maria!","May 23, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

It really made our stay that much more enjoyable, and we were only in the room to wake up and get ready! This hotel is right on Miami Beach with access and connects to the boardwalk. We walked the boardwalk to Ocean Drive one evening and it was really nice. The beach was great and the staff were super friendly and accommodating. Same goes for the pools area and staff. Absolutely no complaints. Food and drinks were delicious and reasonably priced for Miami Beach. Very relaxed atmosphere. Would highly recommend! ","May 17, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

755,"After reading all of the reviews on this hotel, my sister and I booked 4 nights here May 9 - 12th. This hotel is so deserving of the great reviews. I was looking for a great, small boutique hotel on Miami beach, close enough to still do all of the South beach activities, but not so close that it wasn't still relaxing and quiet. The Palms was so beautifully decorated and such a lovely grounds area with great beach access. The staff was excellent and I can't say enough about every one we came in contact with. The beach umbrellas and chairs are free to all staying at the hotel (included in your room). They had plenty of umbrellas and chairs to bring out for everyone. Our room was a queen double bed, ocean view with great interior design and furnishings. The room was perfect for two people but I wouldn't say that it was big enough for four or a family. You would need to get the larger rooms for more than that. While the hotel only has balconies on the top floor, our ocean view room had floor to ceiling windows and I didn't mind not having a balcony. Everything about the room and our stay was so great. The hotel is located in the 30th block on Collins avenue. We took Ubers a lot down to Lincoln Mall, South Pointe Park and Ocean drive. We did walk from the hotel down the boardwalk outside to Ocean drive one afternoon but it is pretty far and hot, so we got an Uber back. The hotel has a great restaurant inside. We had the Ahi tuna salad for lunch, avocado toast for breakfast. Everything we got there tasted delicious. I thought it was reasonably priced for the quality and what you got. In summary, we would totally recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. Loved it. If you are looking for quaint, quiet, well appointed, relaxing, this is your spot.","May 14, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

We were looked after very well and were greeted on our first night when we returned from dinner to a bottle of Prosecco in our room.

Beach is less crowded than other hotels and easily accessible. Hotel is right on the beach with plenty of chairs unlike what one reviewer said. Bathroom was a little tight but very clean.

Staff at the beach, swimmingpool and breakfast is nice.Negative points: rooms don't have a balcony and windows don't open. It's not nice for a beach hotel. Housekeeping works very bad, all days that I was there nobody shows to clean my room and by the end of the day when I arrived and call them, they sent a waiter only to change towels... I also had a bad experience at the check in: the receptionist took my credit card inside the office, out of my view. I was really upset with that and enter into the reception because I don't want ever my credit card out of my view.

I just wanted to relax and be taken care of on my terms. The Palms provided that for me.I had choices of staying at the beach or pool and did both with ease.

763,Currently staying at the Palms - we wanted a few days relaxing before flying back to the UK. We chose this hotel as the resort fee said it included a sun lounger for every guest. Instead we find swarms of people roaming round the pool and beach in search of a sun loungers. The pool staff tell me to come back and look every twenty minutes to look. Really! The reception said it’s Easter and therefore busy and they would see what they could do. An hour and a half later I’ve realised not to hold me breath.

773,"I stayed for a weekend to escape the cold Chicago winter and celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately my friend cancelled last minute due to an emergency, but I decided to go regardless and enjoy my mini beach getaway. I was in two minds about writing this review as I had a terrible experience and the hotel tried hard to make things up to me, but nevertheless I felt I shouldn't let this influence writing about my experience. Unfortunately the hotel's efforts to fix things was too late, after I checked out and I would have preferred a better experience to begin with. Here goes:Day 1: a) Internet was not working. Not great as I needed to work in my hotel room for a few hoursb) Opened the curtains to check my ""City View"" only to find out the view was of the hotel across the road i.e. no ""city"" in sight. I booked a ""city view"" room but instead was given a ""hotel across the road view"". c) Room was not cleaned, despite having the ""service room"" light on for four hours during the day. Returned to my room just after 6pm to find it still unservicedd) Called housekeeping to request my room be cleaned only to be told... wait for it... ""sorry the hotel is full and everyone was too busy, that's why your room wasn't cleaned"". WHAT??? I couldn't believe this. I asked to speak to a manager and was patched through, only to receive his voicemail. I left a message and it was never returned. I called housekeeping again and finally they sent someone to clean my room. I shouldn't have to be so persistent, I paid for a room with an expectation that it was serviced dailye) Went to the beach for a couple of hours in the afternoon. Looked for someone so I could order a drink. Who wouldn't want one on a Friday afternoon, especially when it's your birthday?! For close to one hour I could not find anyone to serve me a drink or give me a menu. Thankfully a guest nearby gave me their menu, more helpful than the wait staff. I could see the hotel beach employees hanging out at the beach hut, talking, playing soccer etc. so ended up going there and ordering my own drink. Finally I had my drink delivered. I was happy to order another one, however after another hour with no-one coming by to ask if I wanted anything else, I gave up. I wasn't going to go and order my own drinks each time when they had beach staff to supposedly attend to their guestsDay 2: a) Don't expect to sleep in. The doors are thin and you can hear everyone talking in the hallway, both guests and staff. It was very loudb) Went to relax at the beach again. Thankfully I learned from my experience the previous day and brought my own drink to the beach. Good idea as once again, there was not one person who offered help in terms of menu, food or drink in the two hours I was therec) Scheduled a treatment at the Spa at 5pm and called early in the morning to see if I could make it a little later so that I could enjoy the sunshine for a little longer (I was escaping the harsh Chicago winter remember) but was told they were fully booked. I arrived at my appointment 15 minutes earlier as requested and waited outside in the waiting area. After sometime I went to check on the delay only to find out there was a mix up and they took someone else in my place. Seriously. How is it possible that this happened? First of all the guy they took in my place was male and second of all if they checked the forms, wouldn't they think it was odd he ticked the female section that he is not pregnant?! This was the real downer of my day as I gave up my one hour of sunshine in the 48 hours I was in Miami escaping the cold to sit inside a cold spa waiting area. And I had called in the morning and was told there were no later appointments. They made it up to me the following day with a treatment however my time in the sun was totally lost and they couldn't make that up to me. Day 3: I was sitting outside by the garden area on a couch, enjoying the sunshine prior to departing for the airport. Two maintenance men came along and removed every single couch and chair around me. This made me feel extremely welcome to sit there (hope you can detect my sarcastic tone). I couldn't believe it. A couple of extra notes: a)They had a strange toilet (see photo) with a wash basin above it. I preferred to wash my hands in the bathroom sink, however the water in the toilet basin would keep running which is not very good for the environment. b) The spa and the service was lovely if you weren't forgottenc) The beach itself is not as nice for swimming as the beach a little further southd) The pool was greatOn check out they asked me how my stay was and when I told them it was terrible they tried very hard to make it better. The lady at reception, Victoria was wonderful, however as I was leaving there was not a lot she could do. In summary, my best experiences were when I escaped the hotel grounds and what was supposed to be a wonderful celebratory weekend ended up being an awful experience in more ways than one and I'll always have negative memories every time I think of this particular birthday. Thank you to all the staff who tried to make it better, however it was too late as the damage was done and I was only there for a short time. I implore you to take some actions and ensure other guests are not subject to similar negative experiences.","March 30, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

Also because we were locals we were to receive a 20% discount when dining at their restaurant. Because we paid cash we didn't receive the discount and when I asked them about it they just gave me the run around!

780,"This place is very nice.. unfortunately it has been one pain in the rear after another since check in. First of all our room was not ready at the 4:00 check in time. (We arrived at noon and were told it should be ready soon while we sat near the pool). I had dinner plans at 5:00 so we had to switch from the room we booked (doubles) to a king room if we wanted a room right then. When our bill came on the final day, they way overcharged us from the price we booked at. Thank God I had screenshotted my booking price. I was told it would be corrected and I’m now waiting on the correct bill to be complete. On the website it says you can self park at a cheaper rate, which is false. I asked where the self-park was and was told that I could only valet or try to find a spot on the street which charges by the hour and would end up being more expensive. The frustration of those experiences took away from the overall stay. I mean, how are rooms not ready at the check-in time when you’re paying a hefty price for the room?!","March 14, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

781,"This is a well-kept hotel with a very nice lobby & lounge and a good restaurant. It's a peaceful base from the excitement of South Beach! Actually, it is in Middle Beach, so it is a quieter and more select area than South Beach. Helpful staff and rooms are very comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is the daily hotel fee of 29 dollars, which covers wi-fi and the lounge chair on the beach. Also, the air conditioning on some floors is rather noisy, the hotel should invest in quieter AC - I was on the 3rd floor and there was a noisy vent just outside my room. Also, they seem to have a relatively small number of live TV channels, for instance, they don't have C-Span. But overall these are relatively small gripes for what is a pretty good hotel.","March 13, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

The view from our room was terrible. While it was on the ocean side, we couldn’t see the water. We were only on the third floor and could see palm trees and that’s about it. Also the alley way where the hotel takes deliveries was right next to our room. We heard all sorts of trucks backing up after 11pm each night. It was terribly annoying.

At first we looked for Hotels in South Beach, close to where all the cool folks stay . But those hotels were quite expensive, and fortunately we decided upon the Palms. The location is only 1 mile up Collins Avenue from the hot spots, and one half the price. (but not inexpensive averaging around $450/night).

785,"Just returned from a 4 day, 3 night stay at the Palms. Beautiful hotel with a great Caribbean feel to it. Its in a quieter area about a 15 minute walk to the noisier hot spots of Miami Beach- which was exactly what we were looking for. The restaurant was beautifully decorated as well- both indoor and out. We ate there for breakfast one morning (not the buffet but from the menu) and food was great. We also had fish tacos from the Tiki Bar menu another day. They were fantastic. The pool area is relaxing and secluded from the boardwalk that butts up to the property. We were there on a busy weekend so finding chairs at the pool was an issue - but not a deal breaker. We spent most of our time at the beach which is steps away and the resort provides chairs and umbrellas (more on that below).We had an ocean front room on the 5th floor. AMAZING view. I did find the rooms to be a little small, especially the bathroom, but there were only two of us and we didn't spend much time in the room - so again, not a deal breaker. The rooms do not have balconies or patios. There is no ""outside area"" from the room if that's what you are looking for- which is a shame because with the perfect view I would have loved to sit outside in morning and watch the sun rise. My only complaint were the attendants on the beach. NOT the servers (the servers were great!), but the ones that helped with chairs/umbrellas. They were not attentive and all three days I had to approach them at their hut and ask for assistance in getting chairs and an umbrella set up. On Saturday the pregnant woman seated next to us was told there were no more umbrellas available. The attendant was not apologetic and made no move to assist in finding one by looking to see if other guests had left the beach - and then move their umbrella. You would think the resort would have enough chairs/umbrellas to accommodate their guests. Moses (the consiglieres) was great!! Very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. The bar staff, bell man, and other staff were great as well! And overall we had a great experience at The Palms.","March 5, 2019","13    The Palms Hotel & Spa

798,"Had planned an overnight trip to Miami, while on holiday in Orlando. I had looked on line and read the reviews of the property. The only conclusion I have reached is people will say good things and do not care where they sleep, if the price is right! The neighbourhood is very sketchy and when we walked into the court yard saw, what can only be described as a crack head, rise up from a sleeping position on the bench. We went into the office and asked to see the room as the manager counted out cash. They probably rent by the hour based on the amount of cash he was handling, in a mostly cashless society. He insisted we pay a deposit prior to seeing the room which we refused. Reluctantly he showed us the room, which looked clean. However, upon closer inspection, the white faux leather base around the bed was stained with what looked like blood and other bodily fluids. We left immediately, to which the manager wanted us to confirm we were leaving as we would not get our money back. Luckily we have the resources to find other accommodations.

AFTER providing credit card to check in, Juan at front desk tells us we have to drive over 8 blocks to their “new building”. Location is an old apartment building that’s been cheaply flipped, had NO pool, not at correct address, and “free parking” is public street parking of which there is none close by. The building was in a rough neighborhood, on a very busy street with no crosswalks, and was totally gross and dirty inside, and people smoking at all hours in the courtyard. Staff is unbelievably rude and have all their lines well rehearsed on why they can’t help you so obviously this happens often, in fact there was another irate customer there with us when we were trying to check out with the same issues as us. We left and stayed at Tryp Bay Harbor (which was great) to salvage our vacation and still have not heard one response from Seaside.

815,"This gets a 3 star because of a few reasons. First off, it's mostly clean and appears to be recently remodeled. Front desk & staff are very nice. It's in a nice enough location. The bed was comfortable. It has limited parking. Your choices are to park on street if you can't find a spot. It needs a few extra touches. Like a clean sponge to clean dishes EVERY SINGLE TIME it is rented. It needs more things like paper towels in the kitchen area & dish soap, dish towels, etc. Some of the dishes were dirty and we had a hard time washing them. Yuk! The staff in the morning gather to clean & talk loudly. They are nice, but loud. The room itself is loud. You can hear traffic noise. The wifi is horrible! It just doesn't work. The remote was broken and they couldn't help us work the TV. We did fix it ourself finally. Floor is dirty. Overall, a great concept, but it needs a few kinks worked out. I felt safe there, though. Would I stay again? Probably. But, not for more than a night or two. It really isn't meant for a vacation stay. Rather an overnight for tired drivers.","December 8, 2018","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

When we entered the apartment it was simply great, new and very nice furnitures, very clean and very nice place, it was much more than what we expected. They also cleanedthe apartment and brought new towels everyday. The hotel is also part of a group called ""South Beach Group Hotels"", which gives you access to the other hotels facilities, like bar or swimming pool. Amazing experience and great value.

Rooms are giant and have all that you need. It is more like an apartment rather than a hotel room- beware any where else in MIA is tiny compared to this. Could there have been a better working stove? Yes, but it was suffice to boil an egg and heck for that price it was amazing. When I read online reviews I was weary as I read about noise and rude staff- nothing could be further from the truth. Those reviews seem fabricated. We had the second building, right by the pool and we slept like babies- no noise whatsoever. Nice cleaning ladies too.

I expected to pick up a package of dry clothes. In order to get them out, I think they ran the washing machine again and my clothes were put into a plastic wet. And were still wet when I got them, a week later. My suggestion: don't try to wash clothes the day you leave (I spent an hour and a half trying to get stuff out the machine) and you'll be fine.

It is located in a bad part of Miami, with dirty streets and filthy beach.2. Staff is unfriendly and rude, behaving like they were doing me a favor by letting me say there. 3. There is no free parking as they claim. The hotel has few spots and if they are taken, you are on your own.4. The room was absolutely filthy with a strong mold like odor and weird urine like smell omitting from AC unit. yuck!5. Owner/management must have hired a good photographer because in reality it looks absolutely nothing like the photos, oh and they cleaned up for sure before the photoshoot. Its a mess outside and in the courtyard.6. They are crazy to charge that much money . Its a 2 star motel with a price tag of a 4 star hotel.7. It has a weird vibe. I walked outside in the morning only to find some girl sleeping in front of my door in a lounge area of the courtyard.

847,"I have stayed at the Seaside Apartment Hotel on about 3 or 4 separate occasions and when I am in the area, this is the place I think of first in terms of accommodations. The property is situated exactly across the street from the beach. Parking is a bit of a horror I would imagine if you don't happen to find a spot directly in front of the property. I believe there are about 5-6 spots designed directly in front of the property for hotel guest. I've always parked directly in front which is really accessible. The rooms are clean and the bathroom lighting is great for make-up application. The actual shower can stand to be refurbished but it isnt offensive. The bed is comfy and the sleep quality is there despite being in such a usually high traffic area. The property offers a complimentary Happy Hour for guest at a local restaurant which is pretty nice, however I've never attended. The staff is really nice as well. the last time I visited, I was helped by a lovely man named David(I believe) he was pleasant and accommodating in regard to my room preference.

848,"This would be a four-star review, if not for a few minor problems. We had an efficiency apartment in the building at 7711 Harding Avenue (the hotel is composed of several different buildings in the neighborhood). The apartment was composed of two rooms, a bedroom and a kitchen/dining/living area. The kitchen was equipped with a range, oven, microwave, sink and refrigerator, and a decent complement of utensils and cookware. There was silverware and crockery for two and a nice dining table, along with a couch.The building is about two and a half blocks from a very nice beach and park. There are many small and larger stores and restaurants a couple of blocks away and a Publix supermarket about 10 blocks down Collins Avenue. The building is across the street from the free Collins Avenue Express trolley, which will take you to South Beach in 30 minutes or so, depending on traffic. If you are on a budget, the ability to cook and the free trolley are welcome. The minor problems: there is only a single lamp in the living/kitchen area, making it difficult to sit on the couch or at the table and read; a door between the living and bedroom areas would allow one person to stay up without bothering his or her partner; the air conditioner in the living area (but not the one in the bedroom) is very loud (not a problem for us, since the weather was rather cool); there was a constant drip in the bathroom sink and, despite a maintenance person coming when we reported it, it was never fixed, there is a coffeemaker, but no filters or coffee, so you will need to run to the market for these, there is no kettle for heating water for tea; the kitchen needs a place to put dishes to drain after washing and at least a couple of dish cloths. A little more effort would make things almost perfect for an affordable stay.Note that the buildings are two stories without elevators, so if you have a lot of heavy luggage, or difficult with stairs, might want to ask for a first floor room. Then WIFI was free and adequate for email and web surfing.Overall, our stay was pleasant. The front desk staff (you check in in a different building) were friendly and helpful.","February 1, 2018","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

849,"My family's experience at the Seaside Apartment Hotel was very disappointing. When we made our reservations, we requested a room with two queen beds and a sofa bed so that our 11 year-old daughter and 13 year-old son would not have to sleep in the same bed. Unfortunately, the sofa bed was broken, so the bed did not completely open. We complained about it to the front desk at least FIVE times during our stay, but it was not fixed until the day before we left. In the meantime, our son tried sleeping on the unopened sofa, but it was so uncomfortable that he put the sofa cushions on the floor and slept there instead. Even after the sofa bed was fixed, it did not close properly (see photo).Also, the in-room washer/dryer did not work at all. The maintenance staff replaced with unit, but the replacement unit did not dry our clothes. I even downloaded the manual for the washer/dryer on my phone to make sure we were using the unit correctly. Finally, there were little things missing: no dish soap for the dish soap dispenser in the kitchen, no soap dish in the bathroom, etc.At checkout, the person working at the front desk suggested that I email the property manager about our experience. WE EMAILED THE PROPERTY MANAGER AND THE SOUTH BEACH HOTEL GROUP MANAGEMENT FIVE TIMES AND RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. Clearly, the management does not care about its customers. We will never stay at one of their properties again.","January 29, 2018","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

Room was spacious and looked clean and neat. Staff did not come across as too friendly but did what was expected out of them. Keeping a phone in the room which connected to the main office would be preferred. Parking may be an issue when the property is full. Coffee sachets would be a great addition along with the coffee machine. Overall, I would recommend the property in which we stayed for families, especially for the price you pay.

854,"I, my wife and my parents stayed at Seaside Apartments for 8 nights over New Year's. They have three buildings, the reception is on 7500 Collins Ave, but our room was on 8320 Harding Ave. The 8320 Harding Ave location was close to the beach and fairly tranquil. The closest grocery stores and cafes were about 1 km away (near the 7500 Collins location). The rooms were clean, except for some of the dishes. The beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was nice. The building seemed fairly new. There was a washing machine in the room, but it was not fastened or properly calibrated, so it jumped out onto the floor during the spinning cycle, and made an infernal noise doing so.

The kitchenette was partially equipped but some of the basic equipment was missing, e.g no mugs or cups, saucepans or can opener. A washing up sponge was provided but it was quite used and I felt that for the price we paid, they could at least have provided a new sponge each time the room changed hands. We asked at reception for mugs and a saucepan and they were then provided. I would suggest that they operate a system of having a checklist of the equipment provided so that each apartment is given identical items. They could check the inventory each time guests check out. The staff were friendly and helpful and most spoke some English. My major complaint is that the Internet was terrible. The connection kept dropping off sometimes every few minutes which was very frustrating. They need to do something about it. ","January 3, 2018","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

You can walk to pharmacies, clothing/novelty stores, restaurants and the beach. The sand is right across the street! There is even a paved walk way that runs up and down the beach for a nice walk/run. Sunset was amazing! It was a little chilly but enjoyed the views of endless ocean. We even saw a stingray swim so close to us in the shallow water! The hotel staff is average. I don't think people in general were too friendly so I don't want to rate them low. I'm from KY so I'm just used to very friendly people, ready to help. The hotel offers beach chairs and towels along with umbrellas to borrow for your day at the beach. That is very nice! This place also has a courtyard that is so lovely. Chairs and palm trees line the area. It was so nice that people were sitting with friends in the evening and using the space in the morning to read the paper. Oh! And free parking!!! It was just wonderful!

867,"Upon arriving the check in area is very small and looks like a former apartment. People were waiting in line while someone was putting a Christmas tree up in the middle of the small cramped lobby. There was no greeting while people just waited for a slow check in process. We finally got to our room and the hot water did not work and I could not take a shower. After going to the front desk to complain, someone came to my room that didnt speak English and looked under the kitchen sink where a small inline hot water heater appeared to not be working. I was told to wait till the morning. I thought you have got to be kidding. I was only staying one night and I needed a shower. I went again to the the front desk and complained. They then got on the phone in front of me not speaking english and appeared to be more worried about if they moved me they would not sell the room. They finally gave me a key to another room. I went to that room and it smelled like smoke and someone had left some kind of bud left in the room. I am not sure if it was tobacco or not or drugs. I went back to the desk again and complained and told them to forget it. You would think settling for a cold shower would be enough but I went to look for an ice bucket to go get ice and there were no ice buckets and the machine was hidden behind the building in a dirty area. Off to the desk again to ask for an ice bucket, again no english and apparently this establishment has no ice buckets and was give a plastic bag at the front desk full of Christmas glitter to go get ice. I couldnt believe it. I will never be going back and deserve my money back. I would not recommend this place to anyone based on what I experienced.","December 2, 2017","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

868,"Stayed at seaside apartment Miami recently for 4 days. The rooms are well appointed and extremely clean. It is a very good location on the outskirts of the huddle and bustle of the city, yet one block from the fabulous beach. We Had an issue with TV, as it was not working for 3 of the days. I Complained each day - to no avail. Needed TV for daily news, traffic and weather each morning and in the evening for entertainment. We were Very disappointed at lack of interest and unresponsiveness from the staff to rectify TV issue. Also refusal to compensate financially at checkout. This has left a feeling of disappointment and hurt at their customer service . This issue should have rectified on the first day (immediately after check in) a simple issue not dealt with efficiently and responsive. I am a regular world-wide traveller so I know what customer service should be; however on this occasion Seaside Apartments fell below the threshold I would expect. I believe that I should have received reasonable compensation for this lack of amenity.Although the hotel was fine - be aware that if you have a problem the hotel adopt a manyana approach to customer service.","December 2, 2017","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

869,"It's a great place to stay. Very attentive accommodating and helpful staff. The room was pretty clean. Woodwork and door knobs could be cleaned of dirty fingerprints. It's well priced, and very convenient to the beach (1 short block) and near small grocery stores, large supermarket and drugstores, banks, a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood with lots of local people on the beach, North Beach has not been gentrified ( the neighborhood is not all tourists). A plus for me.And some of the most terrific cuban, Peruvian, Argentinian and Latin bakeries and restaurants a block away. Lots of options were to eat in walking distance. Also an outstanding burger and shake shop nearby!  Our biggest problems was this is not a typical hotel room with the thought out comfort's, what is missing from these rooms is a real closet, bathroom counter space, shelves, drawers, enough hooks for drying your bathing suits and towels.It's like the rooms weren't designed by someone who understands the hotel guest needs. We had a huge problem with the room where to put your stuff if you're staying for a week. Only 2 very small narrow closets to hang clothes, no drawers for folded clothes. No place to store luggage had to leave it on the floor by the door. I suggest management put in a small dresser underneath the television would have be a great addition to the room. We had to keep our folded clothes in the luggage. The bathroom needs more hooks and shelves for places to put our toiletries it is ridiculous to have two sinks in such a tiny bathroom. Most hotel guests need the counter space.But I still really liked staying here andI've already booked again for February.","November 30, 2017","14    Seaside Apartment Hotel

Called for house keeping, did not come the first time after 2 hours.. called again finally came and she did not speak english (which is not a problem) but if someone else was there to translate and help it would've been better.... we had to point to the stains for her to realize what we needed. They give u towels.. but good luck getting a decent chair or an umbrella every time they gave us an umbrella it was completely broken or a gust of wind wouldCome and it would break, we got broken chairs i guess thats what to expect when its free...but dont even bother giving it out if its destroyed.. we woke up to construction for three days of our vacation.. the exits of our building were blocked off, it was awful..BUT what was worse is that the last day when we were checking out of the hotel another couple was checking in ..they told them that they will only put them in the back building rooms (where we were) for one night and transfer them to the front building because of construction.. they never warned us or bothered to accommodate us. Good luck with the WIFI if you are in the back building, my boyfriend had no data and depended on the wifi during our vacation and it didnt work once no connection at all. The ""HAPPY HOUR"" 4-7 they say is WRONG.. we went at 630 for four dollar apps and drinks at hotel croydon and they continued to tell us this was the wrong information that it starts at 3 ends at 6. Ended up paying full price for everything and drinks false advertising. And ruined our plans. Wish i could get my money back for those three days out of 5 when we woke up to construction every morning struggling to get into and out of our building and rooms.

Water just everywhere outside the door, stepped into room and slipped across the room. Crack in the tables on the floors. Dishes was dirty.

The bathroom is very modern and big. The staff is very nice and helpful. The food is good in the restaurant but expensive as our the drinks.There were a few small things that I did not like the room did not have a chair or a couch, the $35 resort fee did not include an umbrella on the beach and they charge $22 for that, no body shower as u walk in from the beach just for your feet, the music is way to loud around the pool, they don't put in cool water on hot sunny days so the pool water gets to be too hot, weird elevator situation for 8th floor guests where u have to use the staff service elevator or walk on the roof to the main elevator, the maids would forget to replenish the free bottle of water, coffee and wash cloths so you would have to call housekeeping.The guests can be ruthless at the beach we put our things down on some empty chairs and when we came back from swimming in the ocean our things were thrown onto the sand and some people were sitting in our chairs. When we reported this to the attendant he said it can be rough out here with people being rude. So he did nothing.","June 20, 2019","15    Nautilus by Arlo

The hotel gives you 2 chairs for the day at the beach, but you pay for extra $17 a day. If you have a room for 4 people, why don't you get 4 chairs? The food and drinks offered at the beach and pool were delicious, although again, pricey. $70 for a pitcher of frose. They do offer free bikes to ride along the ""boardwalk"" behind the beach which is a nice touch. The room was comfortable, the elevators are a bit tight. ","June 19, 2019","15    Nautilus by Arlo

The restaurant was pretty good. The pool was nice enough but close and crowded. The rooms were fine, though the pormanteau beverage/snack bar in each room was a little gimmicky and the table and chairs pretty unstylish. The metal tabletop had rust stains. Now the negatives: WIFI was very spotty in both private and public spaces. A pretty big inconvenience I thought. No wash cloths.

910,"This hotel is possibly the worst I have ever stayed in. I do not know where to begin with what’s right with this hotel, so let me give you a breakdown of what is wrong;1. We booked a double queen room, with “views over the south beach neighbourhood” quoted directly from their own website. If we had of known the south beach neighbourhood in actual fact meant the air conditioning unit of the neighbouring hotel, I would have rethought my hotel choice.2. Crib requested on booking but completely ignored and had to be requested again once arriving in room.3. After calling the reception desk twice (only to be hung up on), we finally spoke to the manager Mario and communicated our disappointment regarding the view. He agreed to move us to the same standard room but at the front of the hotel, however even this wasn’t a smooth process. 4. Finally arrived in 2nd room - no crib! Mario arranged for cookies and drinks to be delivered to the room which was a nice touch, however 11pm arrives and the room directly above us starts playing super loud music and what sounds only like moving furniture around. We have to complain twice to reception and remind them we have a 9 month old before security are sent up.5. My husband speaks with Mario again, who offers a room upgrade for the inconvenience. We agree and let him know we are out for the day but our bags are ready to be moved. After arriving back at the hotel, we are given our new room 624. No crib again and the bathroom door will physically not close without rubbing against stone floor. The partial sea view again appears to be of an air conditioning unit and wall of neighbouring hotel.6. Finally in anew room as of 30 mins ago...The hotel looks polished from reception area but simply is not. Small bathroom with inconsistent temperature from shower, hallways stink of people smoking weed, no baby changing facilities, two lifts for hundreds of people. My advice for anyone staying here is DON’T! They are a 2 star hotel at best. ","June 10, 2019","15    Nautilus by Arlo

919,"We spent vacations at this hotel with my wife during the second half of last May, we have stayed several times in the past and we come back because everything is running smooth and high quality. Starting with the check in when we arrived they gave me a free upgrade to bigger room that I reserved, wonderful!!!!. Room was very good, king bed comfortable, clean and without any noise which is usual in several hotels. It has a special place for clothes and baggages inside the room, which you keep closed due they have a slicing door. Several plugs for charging electronics, even several USB. Safety box big enough space for Mac 15"" with light inside. A table and two seats very comfortable. Complimentary coffee with a coffemaker machine. Location of the hotel is very convenient, on Collins Ave just 7 minutes walking to Lincoln Rd. At the restaurant we have had two or three dinners, I do not remember well, we found a waiter very kind ( he was from romanian, name escaped from my mind) excellent one and the food was very good at a reasonable price. We do not take buffet breakfast option because is too much food for us and price was expensive, same level than other hotels but still expensive ( usd 25 each person). At the private beach, several steps from the hotel back, the resort fee include two chairs but we should paid the umbrella daily rent for $ 22, my suggestion to the hotel is to give this service for free. People which take care of you at the beach are very nice and they know their job, their names were P.J. , Cisty and Jose, good job guys!. Cleaning of the room was very good and the hotel offer something that I do not remember from other hotels: you can schedule your cleaning room service, i.e. we requested service from 10 to 12 in the morning and they followed my request. I left for the end two issues to be solved which did not bother my vacation but it could get better for the future: bathroom is very very small, I am a big man and it was difficult to move inside the bathroom and the second issue is valet parking, it is very expensive $ 42 and the service was not good, it take more than 15 minutes for getting your car. We were at room 410 which is close enough to the elevators but without noises from them. We will come back to enjoy this hotel for sure in the future.

921,"We stayed in 2 rooms (upgraded to another) The rooms are small but adequate for the price and location to the beach. It's a quaint hotel situated right in the middle of everything. Great restaurants are a short walk away as is the outdoor mall on Lincoln (we saved some money and went to Joe and the juice 2 blocks away for lunch a few days). The beach is right off property with 'free' lounge chairs and towels (you pay a resort fee which covers this). The staff is warm and accommodating and were incredibly helpful. Our first night, the gentleman who was in the adjoining room started blasting his music at 1am then again at 5am. I quickly called the front desk and in a matter of minutes the music stopped each time. Didn't hear him again the next evening. Great job by the staff for fixing that issue. We upgraded to a different room overlooking the ocean. It was very nice but again, there was an adjoining room. We could hear their hair dryer in the morning and basic talking as well. I imagine most of the rooms have an adjoining room as this definitely caters to 'party' people. Bachelor and bachelorette parties. It's also South beach so that's to be expected. The pool area is nice but definitely get there early and reserve a chair and umbrella. The food is pricey but tasty. I cannot believe smoking is still allowed in public places like the pool area. Boggles my mind that in 2019 I have to smell cigarette/cigar smoke while I am lying pool side (I also cannot believe people still smoke in 2019, but whatever). For Miami Beach it was one of the best priced hotels and we thought it was a great stay (minus the smoke and loud neighbor). Hang out on the roof deck. No one is ever up there and it's a great quiet place to view the ocean and read a book away from the party atmosphere at the pool. ","June 3, 2019","15    Nautilus by Arlo

925,"This hotel needs an overhaul. The pity is the location is great, however none of the side rooms get any light, which equals a very dark hotel room. The pool is nice, but there is zero shade anywhere. You have to pay for pretty much everything. The service by the pool when its busy is terrible. The access to the beach is easy and very nice. The pool loungers are comfy as are the beach chairs. The hotel room wasn't cleaned very well, and the tv keps turning itself off despite not being on a timer. I tried reaching out about this issue, but nobody came to fix it. There was hair on the floor of the bathroom and the rug under the bed was rough and looked dirty. There was a pile of chipped paint on my window sill. I feel this hotel is overpriced for the value. The housekeeping knocks starts at 845AM, which in a city like Miami is just too early. The bed was comfy, however I requested a tub, and was given a ADA room. This was ok because I got to have a partial ocean view, however there was these metal bars all over the bathroom which made plugging in a hair dryer difficult. The hotel staff was very friendly however on a daily basis the rooms were not done by 5PM. The AC was locked on a set temperature, and I could not regulate, however it was fine I was not hot. There is a coffee bar in the lobby and a bar. The food is expensive, but very nice. I highly recommend the quinoa salad with tuna.","May 30, 2019","15    Nautilus by Arlo

929,Stayed at this hotel in May. Although the hotel is absolutely lovely upon check out I was presented with a bill for 600 USD. I had already paid for the room and the only incidentals were the resort fee and valet parking. I questioned this amount and the girl on reception told me that it was because they were an ocean front hotel!!!!!When I again queried the bill I was told that that was a bill for someone elses room and the bill of 85USD was given to me. Checking my credit card statement I notice the hotel have taken BOTH bills from my credit card. I am appalled and the hotel have yet to rectify this matter. ,"May 30, 2019","15    Nautilus by Arlo

968,"Two couples stayed here at the beginning of a 10 day trip. We had luggage for such. The rooms have been redone with no thought to space requirements: platform beds that stick out into the room for no purpose, a kitchen size wine cooler in each room that took up enough space where a suitcase could be stored. There was no bureau...no drawers to put anything away. We were not sure why they thought you needed storage for 10 bottles of wine as there was no place to sit to drink said wine.The bathroom was very small. They used a vessel sink on a tiny counter, so there was no space around for anything. They didn’t have towel bars so the tiles had to be stored under the sink, removing any place to put your essentials. Oh, maybe the main thing that describes the philosophy of the establishment as far as comfort and service to the customer....there is no coffee maker in your room as too much space taken up by useless wine cooler. When you seek coffee in the lobby, they explain that you can WALK TO THE 7-ELEVEN for coffee!I know that there are many details of accommodations that are a matter of personal taste, but the four of us agreed that the mattress was the hardest we had ever slept on. The pillows were heavy, hard, and inflexible. I bought a travel pillow at CVS that helped some.","February 13, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

While eating on the restaurant patio it was a bit distasteful for the a staff member to actually be out there smoking while we were eating.

Now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way... the hotel is centrally located to a whole lot of restaurants, shopping stores and even the beach.

We stayed here for 2 nights before our cruise and met our friends here who had flown in from UK.This hotel is in a great location walking distance to South Miami beach and Mexican quarter.Food expensive on the front of Miami beach but Mexican quarter excellent prices and top class quality.Would definitely go back to Chelsea hotel the manager Angel he was very helpful and friendly.,"February 12, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

972,"This was my fourth stay at the Chelsea and all have been excellent. The location is perfect -- a couple short blocks to the beach..I love the classic Art Deco character of the hotel which combines a degree of intimacy that is lacking in some of the larger, more commercialized hotels. The rooms have great amenities (excellent AC) and were very quiet (despite the hotel's convenient location in the center of the action on Washington St.). I've enjoyed the free happy hours and met some very interesting guests and locals there. While the Chelsea offers free shuttle van service to the airport, there also is a stop for the airport-South Beach express bus #150 right on its corner (only $2.50). I look forward to returning.","February 11, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

976,Enjoyed our stay at the Chelsea Hotel. The property was quaint and was in a great location - a few blocks walk from the Miami Beach and right next to a city bus stop. The bed was very comfortable. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review was the hot water in our shower. It took forever (3-4 minutes) to get warm and then the hot water did not last long. The front desk staff was very helpful and gave us good pointers on local restaurants. Plus - the drinks poured during the nightly happy hour were pretty good (and strong),"January 23, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

977,"Booked 2 pre-cruise nights here based on great TA reviews, but wondering if I stayed at a different hotel entirely? The Good - a quick 2 block walk to the beach and restaurants. Our room was interesting -- quite dark but felt cozy - king bed is low to the ground, TV in a strange location, small rectangle table with one chair, very small but efficient bathroom. Fun light fixtures. Only views are of other building walls. The Bad -- after flying red eye and waiting almost an hour for the ""free shuttle"" we learned it is shared by 14, yes 14 other hotels in the ""group."" What should have taken 20 minutes direct took over 60 with all of the stops. Then we were literally dumped off at the last stop at another hotel, 2 blocks away and had to schlep our 4 suitcases to the Chelsea. Check in took another hour as Manager Angel had several disgruntled customers, including me, and did his best to please everyone. I appreciate his extra effort, but by then I was pretty cranky. If you want to use the sister hotel pool be prepared for a 20 minute walk or taking a trolley. The hallway leading to our room was strangely uneven with soft spots and divets making the walk a little treacherous. I'm glad I didn't have to use the elevator.We tried to eat at the hotel restaurant and it was a disaster. First time they were out of the first two things we tried to order so ended up with a quarter cup of guacamole and chips for $7. Second time was a breakfast with eggs prepared incorrectly. We attended the complimentary Happy Hour and quickly dubbed it Unhappy Hour. The bartender could only make a very basic drink that must include either vodka, rum, or gin. No beer or wine included. Drinks served in tiny plastic cups like the type in a Motel 6 bathroom. Music was depressing and everyone just looked sad. I would not stay here again. There are too many fun looking hotels in South Beach to explore! I told Angel my expectations were not met. He is a nice guy and works hard, but I think company policies keep this hotel from becoming the gem it could be.","January 22, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

984,"At first I was a little skeptical of staying at this or any of the smaller hotels in Miami Beach as I saw a lot of mixed reviews posted but I dove in and took the chance. I was surprisingly extremely satisfied with my brief stay at Hotel Chelsea and would stay here again. Checkin/Check out - Check in took a little bit of time. It appears the hotel lacks modern technology which would definitely assist the staff for a speedy and accurate check in. The receptionist was more then accommodating and was clearly doing her best to get my stay in order. I was early and the room was not ready but she got me set up so I could put my luggage down and make use of my time and head over to the beach. Check out was quick and easy and my bill was accurate. The Room- I was given a street view corner room. It was large for a boutique hotel, the bed was comfortable and the room was well appointed with a refrigerator. It was quite considering the proximity to the elevator and stairs and low floor. The bathroom was nice and roomy with some very nice amenities. Only strange thing was the shower/tub had no shower curtain so water sprayed outside the shower. The bar/food - The bar offers a nightly happy hour. Very nice and unexpected- some drinks included. The bartender was attentive and friendly. You can order food at the or outside. The food was awesome, another pleasant surprise. It has a small menu with nightly specials but the chef is accommodating and I believe they will make something special if you ask. Hotel Amenities - The only thing lacking here is a pool but you can have access to another pool owned by the hotel group. They do provide beach towels daily and offer free shuttle service from MIA. The shuttle was fast and convenient. They charge a 20 resort fee which I never agree with but with the little extras they provide it was worth it. Local Area - There is a CVS on the corner opposite the hotel and a 7-11 down the street, they have just about everything and are fairly priced. There are several good restaurants in a two block radius and a really nice Bakery a block over as well. You would be about three blocks in from the beach. This was off peak so I would imagine that certain times of the year this would/could be very busy, much louder and more difficult to find relaxing but for that I would recommend staying in North Miami Beach. Much quieter but also not much activity","January 8, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

985,"you can’t beat the location/ price of this hotel. You are walking distance to the beach and several restaurants. The patio at the hotel is beautiful and amazing to sit outside in the mornings. The service is really great and the staff does work really hard. The room was clean and quiet, and had great air conditioning. The happy hour was great! But.. There were a few minor things that made the stay just a little less enjoyable. While sitting out on the patio, several of the staff members and other guests would sit and smoke cigarettes. It makes it less enjoyable to sit especially when random people from the street come and sit on the patio and smoke cigarettes. The smoke is awful. If they could at least smoke outside the patio, that would be great. There was no smoke smell inside the hotel, which was great. Another minor thing was that our room keys stopped working several times. the front desk fixed our cards a few times. Just a minor annoyance, nothing big! Overall, if you are looking for a simple place to stay and aren’t planning on spending a ton of time in your actual hotel room, absolutely stay here. It’s a great price for the location. They give out beach towels and have a complimentary shuttle from Miami that we took and it was a great bonus included in the price.","January 5, 2019","16    Chelsea Hotel

The bathroom was particularly well renovated. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. We made use of the shared free airport shuttle which made our trip home much easier.

Parking was very expensive so we had to find a parking garage that was a 10 minute walk down the road. It made it very inconvenient especially with 3 kids. The breakfast was also very expensive so we had to eat across the street at a little cafe. The beach is very beautiful here as is the pool area.

One person working at the pool had a towel torn from my wife's hands because she did not lay it down the second he asked her to do so. Then there was the arbitrary (non) refill of toiletries. That was very annoying as we relied on their supply for our daily hygiene needs. One time we asked for a refill which resulted in a very frustrating episode in which we had to call 5 times and wait 10 minutes in queue for some of the calls. When finally someone arrived at the door he brought us only half of what we requested (and what is usually part of regular housekeeping). All in all I would say that the stay was good.

1012,"visited in June 2019 as part of a conference trip in Miami. I decided to stay 2 nights right on the beach before the conference in the city started. absolutely loved everything about this hotel except for one thing that Ill mention later.I loved the cosy ,nicely designed room,nice beach right at the door the location -very convenient with lyft and the free trolley bus that pass the street front of the hotel .all the staff were excellent and attentive. the fried chicken sandwich at birds and bone was amazing.the only minor downside is that you have to pay extra to use the umbrella at the hotels beachfront despite the fact that resort fees have already been paid for. other than this issue, the hotel was amazing. :) thanks","June 30, 2019","17    The Confidante Miami Beach

1018,"Ok I'm going to start off by saying I never write reviews. So this is truly a first for me. A few years back my wife and I visited Miami and to be honest we did not have a good time. So this time around we added another couple. The first 2 days were rained out and our moral was low. Nobody seemed to be having a good time UNTIL we stepped out onto the beach where we were warmly greeted by Chris Holder.Sam, the beach attendant, was a very cheerful young man who always got us a prime spot on the beach. Our servers Chriscaldo (very charismatic) and Nikola were always attentive and made sure our food and drinks were perfect. We didnt even want to use the Eazy app because we loved the interactions we were having each day Back to Chris Holder. Very relatable, friendly,and down to earth. He took the time to get to know each and every one of us. We told him that we were having a mediocre time and this guy went out of his way and wrote us an entire ITINERARY of things to do, places to eat, and even where to party at night. I was speechless. From big venues to little hole in the wall restaurants not only did we check out places on his list, we had a BLAST doing it! Our vacation did a complete 180°. This was seriously one of the best vacations I've been on. Who knew Miami had so much to offer?! Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to thank him in person so THANK YOU CHRIS!Overall the Confidante is a nice hotel with some good things to offer. Prices arent expensive. Great location for someone who wants to be near the action but away from the madness. Staff is amazing and one thing is for sure WE WILL BE BACK!","June 30, 2019","17    The Confidante Miami Beach

The breakfast was delicious - Portions were huge. Lovely view while eating outside. Everything was clean and kept. The room was exactly as pictured. Our room was on the side of the building facing another building, but there was a sliding door with a tiny space to step out and see views of the ocean which was cool and unexpected. Room 303. Loved the rooftop pool. The location was perfect. Walked everywhere, but the Lincoln mall is too far; we texted a golf cart taxi for that. Loved the view and energy of the surroundings. Felt very safe and family friendly. The Leslie seemed classier than some of the surrounding boutique hotels.

1050,"We stayed here (my elderly mother and I) after returning from a cruise and cancelling the catosphropic hotel we'd originally booked and stayed in for a night before boarding our ship, in Fort Lauderdale (the Hilton Beach resort.) This was a gamble, as we knew very little about this hotel and had booked it in the hour before boarding our cruise ship! We were not disappointed. The hotel is stylish, modern and very centally located (it's on the strip - Ocean Drive.) You could see the beach from our room. The roof top pool and cabanas are lovely and not used nearly enough. There's also (in the basement) a well kitted out gym and hot/cold water facilities should you want drinking water.Breakfast was included in the price, which given the extortionate prices for food and drink on the strip, was a relief. You only get 3 options on the free breakfast menu, so if you are staying 3-4 days it's not terrible, however I do feel they could improve the breakfast a little. But it was enough for me - coffee and OJ is served with breakfast. Not bad at all. And if you're not happy with that you can always pay for items off the restaurants a la carte breakfast menu. One thing to note is that we noticed a massive difference between the breakfast staff and the evening staff. Breakfast staff were not at all on the ball, quite disorganised and slow. The evening staff, I'll come to that because we were very very very well looked after by Scotty. You'll read about scotty in other reviews because he is the STAR of this restaurant.The room was spacious. We booked a twin room which appears to have been 2 queen sized beds. it was clean and modern. There was a coffee machine in the room too, a good sized flat screen TV, a fridge you stock yourself (there's a walgreens around the corner...) and a safe. It was quite lovely. The bathroom was again very modern and well maintained/clean. Only one slight criticism was that you'd have thought that my mother being almost 80 years old they would have put us in a room where my mum didn't have to worry about negotiating a climb into a deep tub, with sharp edges everytime she wanted to take a shower. I was really stressing about this everytime she took a shower. Although i know the lovely staff would have changed our room if I'd have asked.The hotel restaurant is situated outside, at the front of the hotel. We ate dinner there every evening, mainly because after a day out my mum was just too tired to go elsewhere. We were served by Scotty. That man is amazing!. I mean, his manner, his care and his attention to just about everything. The evening menu although not super exciting is decent quality and you get a percentage off if you are staying at the hotel. He also gave us some good advice about places to visit during our short stay. This was not my first time in Miami, it was my 3rd or 4th, but it's been some time and he suggested we visit Wynwood Walls. We were not disappointed.Scotty, you were one of the best things about our stay. Thank you. If I owned a restaurant or anything in the hospitality business I'd be stealing you away!I must also mentioned the hotel staff who were all friendly and helpful. The only reason I've awarded this boutique hotel 4 stars and not 5 was the noise. You can't expect to stay on the strip without some noise so you have to be reasonable about that. Our issue was regarding the noise within the hotel. We stayed on the 2nd floor, the main noise was from hotels doors on our floor - when they closed they banged rather loudly, you think people are slamming them but actually it's just the way the doors close. We did mention this to reception who very kindly asked if we'd like to change rooms, but once we explained the source of the noise we were told that a maintenance man would be sent to check the room doors because they shouldn't be making that noise. I have to be honest, it didn't make much difference we still heard it throughout our stay. The other issue with noise was the room above us, we could hear every footstep. Either the floors are not well insulated or we had an elephant staying above us lol.The hotel need to take note of this, because it could stop guests returning and that would be such a shame for this lovely boutique hotel. Despite that we still don't regret cancelling the Hilton Beach Resort in Fort Lauderdale!","May 9, 2019","18    Leslie Hotel

1051,"This property was absolutely beautiful and the location was exceptional. The hotel has been recently renovated and it retained the historical feel while updating amenities. Bedroom and bathroom were beautiful (Only thing I would have liked was carpet in the room but the hardwood was beautiful looking). Rooftop pool and hottub made for the best place to relax, tan, read a book, or swim if you were tired of the sandy beach. Beach was just across the street. We were walking distance to a million restaurants, music, and convenience stores. The art deco architecture in the area was beautiful, especially at night. The downstairs restaurant offers a full menu for all meals as well as an abbreviated complimentary breakfast to those staying at the hotel. I loved the eggs and potatoes for a nice, easy way to start the day. Loved staying here, would definitely recommend!

The luggage guy also gave us a quick tour in our Ocean View Suite. Very good service!The roomOur Ocean View Suite were nice and clean with a big lovely bathroom,- two showers and a hot tub. The only negative thing about the room was the ceiling which got alot of moisture in the bedroom, bathroom and toilet. This will be the only reason for not giving leslie 5 stars,- really a shame.ParkingHotel Restaurant (La Trattoria)Is a pricey restaurant with 18% - 20% additional service charge when you receive the bill. The food though is really quality food,- in other words you get what you pay for. A comment to the restaurant is, Scott the servant is extremely professional and very good at his job. Kudos to Scott! It is worth to mention that if you stay at leslie hotel, then you get 30% off the bill, - we didnt know but Scott did.ParkingYou are able to park just around the corner for 20$/day. We did not have any issues finding a spot for out car.ResumeIf you want to stay in a nice hotel located where it all happens especially In the night, then Leslie is the hotel to book. And do not forget to meet Scott at the restaurant!","April 6, 2019","18    Leslie Hotel

1053,"Stayed here fro three nights with my wife. Great location on Ocean Drive and central to everything you need for your visit to Miami Beach. Nice welcome at reception and the staff were excellent throughout the visit. Our room was clean with an excellent bathroom. Only downside was the breakfast. Don’t be misled by the breakfast included. You have three very basic options. Eggs and potatoes, fruit, or yoghurt with a choice of coffee or orange juice. We expected proper breakfast choices.On one morning they didn’t even have yoghurt ??Overall a good stay and I would recommend apart from the included breakfast.","April 4, 2019","18    Leslie Hotel

1054,"I planned a two week vacation from Chicago to Florida to warm the bones a lil. Initially I booked a hotel in Sunny Isles for 6 days, needless to say that stay was a complete nightmare. On the 5th day of my vacation in Sunny Isles I decided it was time to find something new, that is when I stumbled upon the Leslie. As soon as I walked into the lobby it was the start of a new vacation. The staff, the welcoming lobby, the breath of fresh air instantly made my vacation a hit. The overall experience of this top notch hotel on Ocean Dr helped rejuvenate a vacation which started off on the wrong step. The room was amazing, beds are wonderful, rooftop pool is amazing, friendly staff and for being on the hustle bustle main drag it’s surprisingly quiet. Thank you everyone at Leslie for bringing back my vacation, I’ll definitely be back here again while in Miami! ","March 30, 2019","18    Leslie Hotel

1055,"This hotel is fine and as many have reported has a fabulous location on Ocean Drive and a very lovely, somewhat underutilized, roof deck with pool. The rooms are as photographed, all of that is true. Staff is friendly. The lack of view (being in reaching distance to the building next to us) was made up by the quietness of the room.Included breakfast is underwhelming and you'd be better of having breakfast elsewhere. Overall though, we were disappointed because after reading many, many reviews and paying close to $400 per night we expected more of a boutique hotel feel and that it is not. We go that wrong.  In the future, we would rather stay a few blocks to the northern part of South Beach or off Ocean Drive.","March 26, 2019","18    Leslie Hotel

Drinks at the pool were expensive, but they had 2 for 1 deals. Jacuzzi was great. The free breakfast was pretty average. Good for coffee and a juice but not much else.

1059,"We spent five nights at the Leslie this February. Can’t say enough great things about Lilly, the front desk manager. Super helpful super friendly. The hotel itself is clean and fairly recently re-done but I wouldn’t say it should be classified as a four-star hotel (Loews or Hilton maybe) so you should not think it is a super luxury place. That said, it was a very good hotel,nice rooms, super nice bathrooms and friendly staff, as well as a great value. Location is great if you want to be in the middle of everything on South Beach.

1060,"Stayed here for four nights while in town for the wine festival. The location is perfect, right on the main strip and across the street from the park and beach. A small breakfast was included. It was fine and enough to hold us over. Our room was 2 queen beds and was a nice size for this area. Plenty of room for two people and luggage. A sizable closet was helpful. Bedding was very comfortable. There was a great full-size mirror but the only complaint was the lighting. It likely wasn’t designed by a woman who needs to get ready for dinner or something. Very dark and hard to see. Bathroom was big enough for two to get ready in If needed. Plenty of clean towels daily and toiletries. Staff was very nice and helpful. Many shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Rooftop pool is quiet and they serve drinks and food up there. I recommend it if you prefer boutique hotels to high-rise hotels.

The Leslie hotel is right across from the beach, includes a buffet breakfast outside where you can people watch (which is great fun!) and along a path with TONS of great restaurants. We were there 3 nights and only used Uber/Lyft one night when we decided to venture a little further away. We were away for a girls weeend with 8 girls and the staff at the Leslie really made sure that we were all comfortable and having fun!

Couldn’t have asked for a better location. Staff is really friendly and kind. Check in was quick! BUT here’s the thing, the beds are SO uncomfortable.

Really comfortable bed and a nice bathroom with a relaxing big bathtub and rainfall shower. The room had a fridge and a safe in it which we always appreciate. The included breakfast was served on the front porch with lots of choices. Scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, breads, meat, cheese,bacon, potatoes, fresh fruit salad, coffee, tea and juice. It was all help yourself and was very nice to sit on the porch with a lovely view of the park and beach beyond, across the street. The Leslie is in a perfect location where all the action is and great for walking everywhere. We were able to do and see a lot in the two nights we were there. They also provide towels and chairs to take to the beach across the street. The staff were all friendly and super helpful too.

I admit booking late, and thus was willing to pay a little more. Leslie was very expensive. OK, but then you expect some service, too. However, the place is not worth the money you pay. Lousy breakfast (starting at 8 - and dont even try to get coffee before that), rooms ice cold to begin with, windows locked, lounge is tiny, cheap soaps in the bathroom, of course no newspapers in the morning etc.","December 7, 2018","18    Leslie Hotel

On Sunday afternoon while we were having an excellent afternoon at the pool, my wife asked some basic questions about the hotel and the surroundings of the Latino-looking boy and the boy elusive and under the stairs. He was inattentive. Then he appeared after a while and when he handed over the towels he told us (intently) that he did not speak English.The restaurant in the front is a little expensive but to try a day is fine.

1074,"My husband and I stayed there for 2 nights this past June. We chose it for its location and close proximity to South Beach and action of Ocean Drive. In fact it's across the street from the beach. We loved our stay there. We found the parking a bit overpriced so we parked our car in the parkade just around the corner. Way cheaper but without in-out privileges. Which was fine for us, we didn't need our car. The room was nicely appointed, with comfortable bed, good a/c and nice bathroom. Great rooftop pool with amazing views. We actually spent the whole day there as the South Beach had so much seeweed that it was so nasty we didn't even want to go into into the water. The only aspect that requires improvement at Leslie is breakfast. The food was mediocre. We were sited outside, basically on the street and the sun was shining right into my eyes.

The hotel is so adorable and the staff were so kind. The staff at the front desk made checking in and out so easy. We stayed in the double queen rooms which were also adorable. The bathroom and the floor to ceiling standing mirror were my favorite! They also provide a free breakfast buffet every morning which did not disappoint! There was a wide variety of food and the servers were always checking up on us. The restaurant out front, the Cala Cafe was also a great place to eat. My boyfriend loved their Hurricane drinks! The only regret I have is not being able to enjoy the pool, but since we were only staying for the weekend we wanted to make sure to spend plenty of time on the beach/ ocean since it was right across the street. There is always a doorman in the lobby who is more than helpful and who provided us with plenty of beach towels.The only con was on the first morning of our stay they painted our doors without giving us a warning (there was a warning on the outside of the door, but that would mean that we would only be able to see it coming into the room not when we were coming out).

1085,"We spent 5 nights at the Leslie Hotel on Ocean Drive in a good location opposite the beach. The room was clean and modern with a comfortable bed. Breakfast is included, not a lot of options in the buffet and doesn't start until 8am which is fairly late when you have tours planned. There is a nice roof top pool with a good ocean view. Towels and small chairs are available for free to use at the beach which is great. Being a small hotel, there are only 3 levels. We were on the second level and our room was at the back of the hotel, so now view. However, it was still incredibly noisy most nights, even situated at the back of the hotel away from the main street due to music from the hotels. The hotel room did lack a few essentials such as an alarm clock, paper and pen and a decent chair. There was only a small stool with metal legs that was heavy to move. The staff were friendly, but as it is mostly Spanish speaking, they will often speak to each other in Spanish in front of you. On our first night we went to the restaurant attached to the hotel. We were informed that it was happy hour and 2 for 1 drinks as we were staying at the hotel when we checked in. We waited for about 20-30 minutes before someone served us, then about 40 minutes before they checked on us again and then when we went to pay the waitress said the happy hour deal was only for certain drinks, and not the ones we had purchased. If this was the case, it would be nice for this to be made clear to begin. After this we did not eat at the hotel restaurant, preferring to take our business elsewhere. There were a few maps of Miami around, but there was no sign of tours or travel ideas which you except to find in hotels when on holidays.

1089,"+location+rooms and interior+rooftop deck+gym-service-breakfast-noiseStayed here for a long weekend with my parents. The hotel is in a great location on Ocean Drive, a short walk from the beach and with a lot of food options nearby. They have their own beach towels and sit-down chairs, but note that sunbeds are not provided. The hotel rooms and interiors were modern, nice and clean, and the double room with two queen beds we stayed in spacious enough for three people. One minor downside was the dim lighting in the bathroom and the lack of a magnifying mirror. Also, no slippers. And beware of the noise: the hotel is right on Ocean Drive, with an open terrace restaurant downstairs and music blasting from the other nearby hotels, lights flashing, people walking by etc., so it might not be your hotel of choice if you're a light sleeper. One night, there was also a lot of noise inside the hotel itself, likely coming from the kitchen downstairs. We could hear pans clanking and things being moved well into the night.Our favorite thing about Leslie was the roof deck, which has a swimming pool, a hot tub and lounge chairs. It was clean and not too crowded throughout our stay - somewhat surprising given the great weather. You can order food and drinks from the downstairs restaurant and they bring them up. Watch out though: the food is provided by a separate company and there's a designated ""food person"" on the roof deck. There's another employee / lifeguard on the deck who also looks after the towels. One of them is an extremely rude older lady who scolded my dad for asking her to have a look at the menu while the ""food guy"" was away. Apparently the menu had a dirty plate on it, and it was unacceptable to ask her to remove it from under this ""garbage"". She went on about how she worked for another company and was only supposed to supervise the pool and give out towels. She was very abrasive, and while I understand it may not be her job to clean up plates, she shouldn't have spoken in these tones to a guest asking an innocent question (plus, how's one supposed to know the subtleties of their management and responsibilities?)Overall, the service wasn't inspirational. At breakfast, the 4 or 5 personnel were far more preoccupied with calling in customers from outside than looking after hotel guests. When the buffet ran out of one thing or other, no one would care to replace it. It took forever to grab someone's attention and get them to bring in fresh food and hot drinks. The buffet selection wasn't great either: scrambled eggs, corn flakes and a fruit salad were the only healthy options. No natural yogurt, no vegetables.The small gym in the basement was a bonus. Note there's no shower in the common areas of the hotel so if you arrive early or leave late there's no option to freshen up.","April 2, 2018","18    Leslie Hotel

1090,"My wife & I stayed at the Leslie Hotel in March for just 1 night, after finishing a cruise at Fort Lauderdale and before flying home to the UK. We arrived from the cruise ship at about 9:30am, and were very pleased to find a helpful receptionist who checked our bags into storage and provided us with access to the roof top swimming pool. The receptionist then sent someone to get us when the room was ready about 2pm.The room was an Ocean Suite, with a large lounge, large walk-in shower & bathroom, and multiple windows looking directly over Miami beach. For a single night the room was just what we wanted, to experience the beach and all the eccentricities of Miami before flying home. There are however a number of points to note that may have become issues had we been staying for longer:- The bed and pillows were not very comfortable, the mattress too soft and the pillows made of foam.- The insides of the bedroom drawers were stained, and the units broken in places. They need to be replaced. Not a problem for 1 night as we left our clothes in our cases.- There were 3 wash basins (2 in the bedroom, 1 in the lounge, but rather oddly none in the bathroom) but none of these basins had plugs, so not very convenient for washing and shaving.- There is no door between the bathroom and bedroom, which means the shower when fully turned on actually sprays water into the bedroom, soaking the floor and the side of the bed.But as I say, these points were not too troublesome for our 1 night stay. Guests also need to be aware that the noise from bars and restaurants along the beach continues until the early hours.The rooftop pool is great, with very few guests using it both days we were there, and great views from the pool across to the beach. The hotel serve drinks and snacks at the poolside, however rather than charge to the room the waiter wanted my credit card, and then took it with him into the hotel. In retrospect of course I shouldn’t have let the credit card leave my sight, as when the waiter appeared later with my food he’d lost the card. An anxious 20 mins later he eventually found it, saying he’d left it in the machine and his manager had taken it. Clearly this is a procedure that needs to be improved, with a credit card reader at the poolside.The included breakfast was a self-serve buffet set up within the restaurant at the front of the hotel, the food selection was fine, but the food not very hot.I’m glad we visited, as my name is Leslie and I’ve therefore looked at this hotel every time I’ve been to Miami. On this occasion it was just what we needed for our final night in the USA, but it visiting again I’ll probably look elsewhere.","March 31, 2018","18    Leslie Hotel

1092,"The hotel is newly renovated in a modern style, parting from it’s original deco history.It’s situated in a convenient location at the northern end of Lummus Park, close to great restaurants and the best beaches. The main room is small, but the bathroom is pretty spacious as is the wardrobe. They got their priority straight. There’s a neat roof deck with a pool and lovely views of the beach, but where is the bar? Like most folks here have noted. The noise level from the street is definitely an issue whether you’re a light sleeper or not. We skipped the breakfast run by Cala Cafe/Restaurant. Very cute, but you’ll get the watered down versions of the real deal. We sat down for a jumbo size margarita one day and enjoyed the fly cars amble down Ocean Drive with our “7up Margarita” in hand.

1095,"Finished up a four week driving tour of PalmBeach, CoralGables, FtLauderdale and SBeach. For the money and location and season great little refurbished clean artdeco hotel. Given that, no real views only adjacent hotels either side but did avoid back alley ! Front ocean view rooms priced accordingly we presume. Great designs for rooms, very boutique with brilliant roof terrace and smallish pool/jacuzzi, great low level ocean and beach views ! Now bearing in mind that Miami is a LatinAmerican city and culture and language with different work ethics and service standards, our employee of choice here was Edin, the hotel tech/super who was there for everything, great attitude, fast, fairly good English and (a rarity down here) proactive! What you don't see or get in room, ask. No coffee/tea makers (!!?), but they found me a kettle. Also sent up a rather done steam iron and odd miniature Euro-ironing board (hate them!). Also there is no lobby coffee/tea service or bar as advertised, so one of those rough-around-the-edges thingies so characteristic of Florida hospitality industry we have endured over the decades of snow-birding. Room rate came with complimentary so-so breaky buffet on the front, fun terrace beside OceanDr with busy street/beach views, generally good, but operated by a contracted restaurant service that is a totally different review ! Lunch, dinner read buyer beware, watch the fine print, but does offer 30% hotel guest highly-qualified discount. Very South Beach ! But food was excellent ! So would stay at Leslie again, for sure ! Oh, for Miami/SouthBeach we find one really needs some Spanish at least at service levels if only to ease your vacation !","March 2, 2018","18    Leslie Hotel

Both lovely rooms. 102 was our favourite however two things, firstly the AC unit is really noisy, we switched it off at night to sleep and secondly, the traffic noise is loud, especially on a Saturday night.

1103,We stayed here before boarding a cruise. We have stayed on Collins Street before and like the area. We were disappointed with the location and the staff. Seems like it is not run very very well and lacked in customer service. On the first day we got up and while my husband was in the shower the water went off. We were not told about the water being shut off and the other 3 of us could not take showers. When we went to check out we asked for an adjustment because we didn’t have water for the day and we were told they would not do anything because they had been having water problems for the last 2 weeks and they were happy to have it fixed. They said we were lucky to have water for the last day and it had costed them so much money they could not adjust the price. For $250 a night I did expect to have water or at least be accommodated. The hotel was clean and the rooms are big. I would say with all the great hotels on Collins Street try another one. ,"December 7, 2018","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

The staff is friendly and always willing to help with a big smile on the face, all of them - Marina, felipe - but i would like to point Osama who is extremely helpful, great to solve problems, and an outstading posture just as we expect from a hotel staff. And as a bonus they prepared an amazing suprise for us. The hotel has a really toughtful and caring staff, and the manager, Daniel, is doing a great job. Ithaca, thanks for being there in south beach for us. About the bad part, In my opinion is already ridiculous enough for you to pay to stay in a hotel and is not a 24 hours stay, each day more hotels are decreasing the amount of hours; i've been to one that check in was 16:00 and check out 10:00, what is ridiculous, but i arrived 8am and wasn't charged early check in. Ithaca has a 3pm check in and 11am check out, which i understand because if every hotel does it, so will it, and is acceptable, so the hotel have time to prepare the rooms etc... but to charge for an early check in, or late check out, if you have the rooms available, it's just too cheap, and i think is unacceptable enough to decrease the hours plus you get charged for arrive early in what should be your right?! It was really dissapointing, I MEAN IT, REALLY DISSAPOINTING, that Ithaca wanted to charge me 30 dollars for early check in my 1:15pm arrival. It's not about the money, it just seems like excess of greed, as if you don't care much about the customer well being as you care about the profit, and even though we ll know it works like this, nobody wants to feel that posture from a hotel.","February 14, 2018","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1120,"We went there for one night as we arrived from Switzerland by plane. The Hotel is small bit shiny, but the place where you can have breakfast is tiny and pretty dark. The variaty is also very limited. We know that south beach is the in place of the party scene in Miami and for that reason we also exspected of course not a silent surrounding. But when you're lying in bed and you have the feeling that every car from Ocean drive is actually driving through your room, then you know how we felt. We had a double room that was clean and big, but the old art deco building should get a soundproof update asap. For the money we've paied we can not recommend this hotel. For this overrated high price location you definitly get better and nicer hotels close by for less money. So it was a OK experience with less sleep.","January 5, 2018","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1121,"This hotel is so hidden you might pass it while looking for it. It doesn't look like much from the outside and it appears to be a bit small. You will be pleasantly surprised when you go to your room. I love the beachy decorated rooms and it offers plenty of space. The fixtures are modern and I found the room to be very comfortable. I had a king sized bed and it was very cozy. I found the cost for my room to be very economical for the room. The rooms reminded me of a Kimpton hotel. The staff was very nice also. This hotel is very close to the action on the South Beach strip and beach. It is literally a block away. It is also a very short walking distance to shops of all sorts. I didn't have a car on this trip, but I easily shopped and visited Zara, Walgreens, bank ATM, vegan store, sunglass hut, the beach, etc.Note: You have to put your luggage on a life and then walk up a flight of stairs to meet your luggage. This is no big deal for me, but others might find this to be a chore.","October 25, 2017","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1122,"I booked 2 hotel rooms before our cruise in March 2018. I booked directly with this hotel over the phone back in July and confirmed with them their cancellation policy. The other couple we WERE traveling with need to cancel. I have been attempting to keep one of the rooms and cancel the other one for the past 10 days now! When I called on 10/13 I was told only a manager could complete the request and I’d see a confirmation email and refund in a couple of days. Never happened. So on 10/17 I tried to contact them via their website where you submit a question. I never heard anything. Now today I call, NO answer. Phone just rings and rings and rings, then turns into a busy signal. I’m VERY concerned. ","October 24, 2017","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1127,"Little bit late with this review!! We had a really nice stay at this hotel for 3 nights pre cruise.It was our first time in Miami and we enjoyed it very much.The hotel is in a great position near to the shops, beach, restaurants, transport, etc.Our room (108) was the Queen room and although not as large as the other rooms, it fulfilled all our needs and was exactly as described on the website. Good comfortable bed, linens, pillows, bathroom, towels, bathrobes, amenities, etc. Lots of nice ‘little extra’ touches in the room. It was very clean but like a couple of other reviewers, on the second day we returned mid afternoon for a rest and the room had not been serviced. It might be a good idea to inform the office if you are not going to be out all day to avoid this. We elected just to take some clean towels etc. as they could not start the clean for another 40 minutes.Really nice continental breakfast with good fresh produce on offer and we especially enjoyed the yoghurts.Sadly the breakfast area is very small (only 2 tables) and unfortunately our smaller room had no facilities to enable us to take the breakfast to the room as some other clients could. However, we were lucky to get seats each day.Happy Hour in the afternoon was another nice touch with wine, juice, cheese and fruit being offered in the lobby.Brian and Marie were very friendly and helpful and made you feel very much at home.Hotel does not have a passenger lift but does have a service lift for your luggage.WiFi was excellent.Would stay in this hotel again if we were to plan another visit to Miami.Final note – don’t forget to return your room key card at the end of your stay or you may get charged!!","April 27, 2017","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

Our room was huge, tastefully decorated and immaculate. Quality toiletries and bath robes were a nice touch.The continental breakfast was basic but was all we needed to start our day.The provision of deck chairs and towels for our days on the beach were very much appreciated.

A Special thanks for Lily, Maria and Agatha:)) Basically our luggage didn't make it to Miami airport upon our arrival (and we were panicking as we had to leave for a cruise just the next day), and they spent the whole day and night on the phone with the terrible customer service of British Airways trying to track down the luggage for us.This was not requested and totally out of their interest, but they literally didn't have peace until they managed to get it sorted!!Thank you again and see you soon:)Paolo & Barbi","April 20, 2017","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1131,"The Ithaca is on the south end of Miami Beach, just a block off the main drag and the sea. Despite being in the heart of the action (and there is a lot of action--crowds, cars), the hotel is remarkably quiet. Small, but friendly staff. As others have mentioned, the hotel can, at first, be hard to find on the street. There's no marquee, just a sign on a regular-sized glass door. This is a great contrast to most other hotels in the area, which grab you by their exteriors. The Ithaca has fewer amenities than many hotels, like a concierge, bell hops, etc. It's the kind of place you should go if you're comfortable taking care of your own needs. The rooms are large and clean and bright--kind of Ikea-ish. There's a nice continental breakfast: breads and bagels, yogurt, cold cuts. We understand there's a wine hour in the evening, but we were never there to try it. We give the Ithaca four stars, not five, for three reasons: (1) the mattress sagged, (2) the wifi was a bit inconsistent, and (3) the bedside lamps were of an odd glass that cast a prism-like light, making reading difficult.","March 26, 2017","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1134,"Ithaca is on Collins Avenue, basically the street parallel to Ocean Drive, the hotel faces all the stores on Collins Avenue. Its sort of hidden as the entrance is small with a stair case leading to the hotel floor. Its basically more like holiday apartments but run as a boutique hotel. The rooms are massive, well from what i know all are, as ours was enormous even with a lounge set on the other end of the room. Shower and room facilities was excellent. The Hotel also has its own 24hr parking, (basically a valet) but there is a massive parking lot just across the road, which is reasonably priced. Of course the best way to get around Miami/Florida is with a car so parking facilities could be thought of as mandatory. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but does offer a small compliment breakfast in common areas. Just behind the hotel is ocean drive with an abundance of eateries, so finding a good place to eat with a view is easy. If your spending the day on South Beach then I would recommend taking the hotel provided umbrella/beach chairs (Free) but its on first come first serve, so get up early and reserve yours. We stayed over in December between Xmas and new year rates where high, but i think that is more based on the location rather than season.","February 13, 2017","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

1139,"We stayed at this place from 12th to 17th December 2016, after seeing photos online and reading overall positive reviews.It's not really a hotel but more of a bed and breakfast, although breakfast choice is very very limited, not even having cereals available. There is not an actual dining room but a small lobby converted to use for breakfast each morning.First time around, the entrance to the hotel can be hard to find too. Even Uber was struggling as it took the car to the adjacent side street. Don't think about parking here as it is all chargeable 24/7. We cancelled our car and stuck with Uber for the trip.Staff were all, without exception, very friendly and helpful, especially Maria. The room we had (106) was a very spacious room indeed, even with four of us sharing. There are sufficient facilities but less than what you expect at a hotel.Location is good, close to shops and beach although as expensive area to stay in. Wi-fi coverage is good and it was not too noisy for us.Eating around the corner on ocean drive is VERY expensive. There is a mall nearby, but if you go to Dolphin Mall (about 25 minutes by car), there are many more shops and a food court.There are a number of hop on hop off bus services and they may seem like a good deal, but consider what you really want to see, as the round route can take up quite a bit of time, and it may just be cheaper to use the local bus service or Uber. There is also a free tram service looping around the area which goes near the local mall too.For a cheap haircut or hair styling, there is the American Beauty School at about 5-10 minutes walk, with students who can do you hair at a fraction of the normal costs (as they are students!!).Check out is 11am so there is plenty of time to get yourself sorted in the morning. the accommodation is all on the first floor above shops, and there is a small lift, mainly for luggage use!!","December 30, 2016","19    Ithaca of South Beach Hotel

Breakfast was very good, they were constantly replenishing the food, unfortunately there are only 2 tables so one morning we just ate in our room which was also fine. We had 2 complimentary glasses of fizz and I love that they offer free wine and nibbles in the evening.

In walking distance from ocean drive which includes the beach and fantastic restaurants. Hotel staff very accommodating and device oriented. The one thing I would say is request a room towards the end of the hallway and not close to the check-in desk.

Mild anxieties after our shuttle driver informed us that he had never heard of the place were soon replaced by nervous anticipation once we arrived at the small awning over the outside door. A steep flight of stairs led to a pristine lobby and a friendly welcome from staff. But the best was yet to come. Our room wasn't quite ready and when we came back a few hours later to our cleaned room we we stunned. WOW! What a beautiful space. Large, quirky, clean, stylish.. what else can I say. Just stunning.

I contacted the hotel, they had it all, and sent it back to me! What's better is that they sent it before I could pay them for the postage: talk about the honor system! If I ever return to Miami Beach, this will be my go to place. What a gem!!One note: there is an elevator but for luggage only.

They gave us the last room of the corridor, we had to dodge the cleaning service tools to enter. The room was fine, small but good bathroom and comfy bed, all very kitsch. The rest of the hotel was a bit dark and claustrophobic and the place where they serve the breakfast (in fact, the lobby with just two foldable tables) was ridiculously tiny (in fact they have trays in case you want to take it to your room). On the other hand the breakfast itself was completely dispensable, no appealing at all. Finally I read here people complaining about the service, in our case it depended on the people, the one who charged us was quite curt but the others were very nice and helpful.

Some will go above and beyond to help you and others are rude and unwilling to help. Breakfast is included. Basic but enough to keep you going til lunch. Pool is small with sun loungers but we never had a problem getting a sun lounger. It is a 3 min walk to the beach. 20-30 min walk to the centre of south beach. However there is plenty of transport options. We used to get the free Miami Beach trolley which brings you right to the center. We were supposed to stay here for a 2 night stop over before going on a cruise. For this purpose this hotel is ideal.

1157,"I looked for the restaurant of this hotel but didn't find it. Since we arrived, the hostess was not very friendly...but we ignored this. We were a table of three and ordered a pizza and the salmon only, two dishes. After over an hour of waiting one of us asked the hostess who said she would check what was going on...but we're pretty sure she forgot our order because within 15 minutes of that we had our food. The salmon with mashed potatoes my friend had was tasteless and overcooked. At least they didn't charge us for this dish since she refused to eat it (this is the only reason I am putting two as a rating instead of one). But unfortunately she had to go to bed hungry because by the time we were done everything else was closed. Our pizza was not horrible but it wasn't great either. Service in general was bad...after we ate we had to go inside because the waitress/hostess didn't even come to check on us. We are never coming back here and we suggest you do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant.

1159," I chose this hotel for the fact that they offered a hot breakfast every day that you stayed there. Now anyone who knows me, knows I take my breakfast very seriously. Do not give me a cookie or a cupcake and call it a day. This ended up being the biggest disappointment with my stay. Breakfast is 730 to 11 and I would get down there about nine and the food was more than halfway gone. The first morning I came down I assumed they would be refilling the empty stations that were there; there was one tray of scrambled eggs, another tray that had three sausage links in it and a third tray that was empty. While I was at breakfast no one refilled the food. They had a waffle iron to make waffles but if you weren’t in the mood for a waffle you were out of luck.  They also routinely ran out of flatware and plates during the breakfast hours. You were left there waiting until someone came in to replenish these needed utensils. They seemed to be short staffed throughout my five-day stay. The one bartender was also the person who made bloody Mary’s and mimosas in the morning, bussed tables inside the restaurant, and also bussed tables outside by the pool. Also, the first night I was there I went down to the restaurant for dinner, something light. When I asked for the chicken wings I was told that anything that needed to be fried was not available. I don’t know if their fryer broke but the salad with grilled chicken that I had instead was a not a very good substitute. My room was nice, large, and clean. My bed was very comfortable. The furnishings and decor seemed to be on the chintzy side, but that is something you have to deal with when you do not go with a chain hotel. While I was there two of the days my room was never made, the first time I called the front desk and they sent someone, the second time I just said forget it and dealt with it. Any of the staff that I interacted with, were very nice and accommodating. The bartender was a very hard worker so I hope she is compensated accordingly (I made sure I added to her tip jar when she waited on me).  Overall, I had a good time while visiting Miami. This little hotel could do so much too heighten their visitors experience while staying there, I hope that they do so.","May 26, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

1163,"Myself and my partner had booked a week stay, well aware that it was a cheaper alternative to the hotels around. They gave us “complimentary” breakfast, which we found to be self service. Which again is not a problem as you get what you paid for. One morning we went down to have breakfast as usual, we were confronted by a very unorganised layout, there were facilities to make waffles however there was no assistance as the machine seemed to be malfunctioning. When we asked the manager he went onto explaining it was “self service” but we only just needed assistance really? We then went ahead and sat down trying to have what we found, the manager approached us and said he’d like to know why we were asking who the manager was and what the problem was. While we ate our breakfast he abruptly disturbed us. I tried to explain that ill speak to him after we’d finished eating but he was very insistent to know what went wrong. Which we found to be incredibly embarrassing as well as unprofessional. Other hotel guests were looking over at us and that is clear defamation. I would recommend this hotel if you are not looking to spend much and the cleanliness of the rooms were okay too. However it is over priced for the facilities provided and the management needs to review their customer service.","May 15, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

If you like plastic knives and forks then you’re in luck. If you like a mish mash continental breakfast which apparently is included in your booking fee then go for it... if you like dark corridors to your room then this is the place for you. If you don’t mind paying out for expensive meals and eating basic food then again this is the place for you. The rooms are basic, the website photos must be old as there are very little similarities compared with the real picture....

1168,"I booked the hotel through a vacation app I have (secretscapes) and was thoroughly happy with our visit. When I booked the hotel, I didn’t take into account that it was going to be Spring Break in Miami Beach, FL. We arrived and the hotel at 11am and went to the desk to ask if there was possibility of an early check in. They explained there wasn’t any ability to do that, but we could check our bags with them, grab some beach towels (complimentary), and head to the beach for a couple hours if we wanted.We got changed in the bathroom and left the bags, collected our towels, and headed out for some SUN!(We were coming from Philadelphia area in mid March, so lots of sun was in order).The front desk crew were always courteous and helpful. The overnight desk guy was always so friendly and happy to see us. Always a smile on everyone’s faces! We checked in and rested a bit then headed down for the complimentary drink. Mica at the bar was so friendly and helpful, and just a really fun energetic person to be around and chat with. At night, we made our way down into the madness that was Miami Beach spring break. I can’t even comment on this, as I’m sure most people have heard stories about this year’s goings on. After deciding that the lights and sirens and crowds of people (all of them probably 20 years younger than myself and my partner) were all a little too much crazy for us, we went back toward the hotel, grabbed a 6 pack of beer up the block, and headed to the front sitting area of the hotel where we met Benjamin and the other doormen. This became our usual hang in the evenings for the rest of our trip, as they were such great people and just fun to be around. We were there for 4 nights, and the accommodations were a fun little change from your usual everyday hotel. The lobby, mostly in white with bright red accents was a delight. The cleaning crew kept the areas gleaming through all the traffic of people in and out. (An impressive feat, in itself)The morning breakfast offerings were adequate, however made things a little less interesting for a vegan. But they did have fresh fruit and juice and toast. Only suggestions I could make would be to have maybe another protein available (even just peanut butter) for those who don’t eat animal protein? Also for the ones who do, it always seemed as though the food was gone or nearly gone, and took a while to fill back up. The young lady working the breakfast detail was hustling around and was always sweet and helpful and kind and works her butt off there! All of the workers are constantly moving and grooving, at no time did it seem like any of them were bored or had nothing to do. The owner/managers (pointed out to us incidentally because we had overheard a conversation between workers) was always friendly and available to the staff. They were also quick with a smile or handshake. This kind of service is a dream (for me) when you’re on vacation. Who wants people who are in a bad mood serving or helping them? We get enough of that in the city!Anyway, thank you so much for being so wonderful, and if we ever find ourselves in Miami Beach again, be sure we will stay there.

1169,"I have been in this hotel for 3 days during an exhibition in Miami and I chose it because was quite close to the exhibition center and also to Lyncon road. When I visit a new hotel I try to understand what is being, the style, the concept, etc., but in this case I was not able to provide any replies to my questions. The building is very hold even if white painted gives a different impression. The Staff speaks differs t languages. Rooms are quite big, they have all the amenities but need lot of maintenance because are suffering for broken parts, missing parts, etc. Bathrooms are small and really, more than the rooms need a lot of maintenance, lot of broken parts, scratches. Noise insulation is something very bad. I have seen just few other situations like that. You can hear people talking in the rooms next to you. The temperature of the AC can't be adjusted. Or you get frozen or ovewarm. The blankets of the windows are too small. Breakfast is cheap and really essential. The price of the hotel is too high vs the quality and service. Only one good and positive points the speed of the internet connection and the kindness of the Staff. There are other solutions for sure in Miami. ","March 29, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

1170,"i was really hoping to love this hotel.We are locals and we're always looking for a nice hotel on the beach to have staycations.Unfortunately, this will be our first AND LAST time at this hotel.Worst part is that it wasnt even about the service we received but the room we were given.IT LOOKED NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THE PICTURES LISTED HERE.All the updated showers, wood floors, updated wood vanities did not exist in the room we were given and the worse part is that when we were checking in, the front desk told me they were giving us one of their best rooms.Very upsetting experience.Here were the issues we encountered:- Room quality was poor; door to the room was located directly IN the stairwell (we were warned that it was by the stairwell but not clear that the entry was WITHIN the stairwell where you had to go through the stairwell door to get to the room door)- Room smelled musky (and it may have been because of the carpet in the room plus the A/C issues in that room).- A/C was not working upon arriving. (It was temporarily fixed, however, upon check out the next day, the thermostat was starting to read high temps again).- Beds were comfortable but sheets had a little bit of an odor.- Bathroom sink had some black mold on the rim.- Wall corners looked dirty.- Chair in the room had dried up residue on it.- Pool was very very cold (could be because of the weather/none heated pool) but when sitting in the pool area, looking up at the roof you saw some broken lights and worn out.We had an early check in and during the time of check in the front desk clerk assured that we were being given one of the best rooms in the hotel but considering the above mentioned issues, we received far from a great room.The only positive experience we had there were the friendly valet workers.We really wish we had a better experience.","March 25, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

1184,"Red South Beach HotelWe stayed 2 nights prior to a cruise and hotel was booked via our TA and perhaps not my first choice. Before travelling I had followed the comments on Trip Advisor and was quite anxious as to what standard I would find. I need not have worried – the hotel was absolutely fine. The reception staff were, as others have commented, extremely friendly and the hotel is about 5 minutes away from the beach. There are two small supermarkets, an Italian restaurant a Subway, wine shop and a coffee shop again about 5 minutes’ walk – turn right outside the hotel. Big Bus and trolley bus stop is literally across the road outside the Riu hotel. The breakfast for 10$ was fine – yes a bit limited but what do you expect for 10$, and the free cocktail was very nice – my first ever tequila sunrise which is now my drink of choice. Our room was the smallest on offer and it was fine – bed was extremely comfortable, the room was clean and yes although tight you could sit on looHopefully I have helped others dismiss some of the negative comments written about this hotel.

1187,"Stayed here just me and my daughter for her 12th birthday gift and the service was absolutely brilliant. As a service manager myself, I always judge the service being offered to me in any given environment and these guys were great. From concierge to janitors and housekeeping they all greeted us with smiles and ‘hola’ everyday. I left my phone in the taxi on arrival and after helping me call around to find the driver who had it, Nuri on the front desk offered to pay the $35 taxi fare from her own pocket for him to bring it back later that day so we could go to beach and not miss out on a sunny day waiting in reception for the driver to return. She and her manager Zaniada also gave us breakfast vouchers on the day of my daughters birthday and secretly went to our room and dressed it with some balloons as a surprise for when we went back up. This kind of service just isn’t found these days!!! If I had to balance the review and add a negative I would just say that the decor is a little odd and mishmash so, if you are staying here and want to be blown away by interior design it’s probably not for you however, if you want amazing service, kind and smiling staff, clean rooms, decent food and a location which is just a minute walk to south beach all at a price point which this place enters at then I’d recommend Red South Beach. Also, if you’ve never been to Miami before and worried about location. Again, its across the street from the beach and the Miami Beach trolly (a free bus service) stops outside and runs down to Lincoln Road outside mall in less than 10 minutes (otherwise a 20 minutes walk). Overall a fantastic experience and one I hope to repeat next February to escape the dreary, grey British weather.","February 19, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

1195,"Triple A is what I can say about our stay the Red!! AMAZING, ACCOMODATING, ASS KICKING STAFF(fun and friendly). First, I went on a quick getaway to Miami to escape the freezing cold of the north. What a great trip it was!!! I really enjoyed the Red for its authentic look, lounge is always clean when we wait to check in, The room was nicely set up and spacious. The front desk staff are always smiling and helpful. We also got to do some things we didnt get to last time. Nury the Concierge booked us a City of Miami Tour and a trip to the Everglades. My wife and I were happy, especially my daughter. I had issues with the hot water in the room and Nury helped resolve it. She always greeted us with a big smile and greeted us when we came to the hotel. Another employee named Felix helped me open the safe. All in all my visit to the Red was a wonderful time..my daughter loved the pool like any child would have, the drinks from 5 to 7 were priced fair and while i drank my grey goose my wife had a Cosmo poolside. The Miami scene would not be the same if it wasn't for the stay at the Red as our preferred choice to stay. Thank you for making my family feel welcome and the wonderful experience. 100% satisfied highly recommend the hotel.","January 26, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

1200,"I had the misfortune of staying at this hotel during New Years because the hotels we like to stay at were sold out. I honestly feel lucky to never have to ever stay in hotels like this and that the rates were higher for New Years bringing in a better clientele because the day we checked out, the people checking in were questionable. If you let people walk into your hotel with no shirt on, pants so low you can see their underwear, swinging a half empty patron bottle around then good luck to you. Now while it’s a 3 star so I knew it was going to be bad compared to what I’m used to, but this place is absolutely horrendous. The beds are SO hard and uncomfortable we actually woke up in pain and my neck is still sore from it now. The rooms have all carpet (gross), there are no curtains so all you have to block light is a shutter. So the only time the room is darkened is at night time and even then it’s not dark because of the street lamps. Curtains also provide noise blocking so of course you can hear everything from outside. The bathroom is so small that you cannot sit on the toilet straight because your legs will hit the bath. the toilet is rusted out at the bottom so it looks dirty. The rain head shower is placed up so high that all you get is a little trickle, so washing takes forever and almost impossible to wash long hair. The corridors to lead to the rooms were so tight and dark with low ceilings it was anxiety inducing. The worst part of this hotel is the restaurant inside of it - Barok where employees like to steal your money. I ordered a drink during ""happy hour"" which turned out to be very far from happy. It was buy one get one free and the drink was $12.00. When I got the check I noticed that it was not itemized and the tab was $17.00. When I asked the bar tender what made it 17 he said it was ""taxes and fees"" i said ok and walked out even though I knew it wasn't right. My friend was picking me up so I sat in the lobby next to the restaurant and overheard the bartender and server talking about me, first in Spanish and then in English, because they didn't realize I was right there. They were complaining about me asking why it was 17 and she shouted that she was sick of people asking why it's $17. I went in the restaurant and told them I could hear them talking about me, and she instantly became defensive and rude and started shouting like ""excuse me?!"" And I told her if she was sick of explaining to people then they should itemize the receipt so people can see clearly where their money is going. ""You need to shut up and get the f$$$ out of my restaurant"" was her response to that. I turned to leave because I'm not going to argue with some uneducated server, and she said ""yeah that's right keep walking"" as I walk out. This happened on December the 30th at around 5.30pm. When I told the reception staff they apologized and tried to find the owner for me but he wasn’t there and she told me if I saw him to tell him. That’s not my job. Clearly no one in this hotel cares about hospitality and they need to take a serious look at their employees because that isn’t how to treat anyone.

1201,"My husband, parents and I stayed for 5 days over Christmas.I felt the price was reasonable for the 3* rating, relative to Miami being expensive anyway and the xmas spike!Let's start with the positives:The location was great - across road from the beach and near enough to the attractions of South Beach without being bang in the middle - and the hotel had a nice pool, deck area, bright foyer & restaurant and small gym. It was clean and breakfast went on until 10.30am, which was helpful! Our room was quiet as it didn't face the street, but my parents had some noise. We had beach towels and chairs every day, and for those who like a happy hour drink you're in luck - free one every day 5-7pm!However..... it's in need of maintenance. We were disappointed on arrival; one of the lifts was out of service, the other - even given increased use - was extremely slow. We had trouble connecting to wifi and it was off and on. My parents' air con was too cold and couldn't be turned off. There was no tea making facilities in the room (but being English in the US perhaps we're expecting too much!). The breakfast was ok if you enjoy carbs and heavier food but could have had more fruit, muesli etc. It wasn't included in our Booking.com price either. We would have liked to use the pool but it didn't seem heated or warm enough to swim in.The gym was tiny and in a room with no windows.It was unfortunately that some of the maintenance issues happened over xmas, when it was probably hard to find available handymen (although all hotels should have them!). However, once we complained my husband and I were given a free bottle of bubbly, breakfast included, and 1 free night, which we appreciated. So because the staff were obliging and rectified our complaints overall we felt it was a good experience and we would be happy to recommend.","January 5, 2019","20    Red South Beach Hotel

Coworkers who stayed for the same conference all had the same issues - broken lights, no coffee, broken pocket doors, shower drains that were clogged - they complained and nothing was ever resolved.

1226,"We stayed in the Kaskades building of the Gales Hotel. It is in back of the Gales on James Street. The rooms are large and offer a balcony (you can either get a King room or 2 Queens). It is quieter and calmer than the Gales with its own small rooftop lounge with small pool (the Gales has a larger one and a robust happy hour). The hotel offers a very nice complimentary breakfast with outstanding and attentive staff at the Gales. The hotel is in an excellent location a block from the beach, offering beach access and free chairs. I loved the quirkiness of the 2 buildings. The hotel offers many amenities that we did not take advantage of but which are notable, especially given the small boutique nature of the hotel.The Kaskades’ rooms offer a heated automatic Toto toilet (odd in a warm weather environment), sophisticated lighting which is very confusing with switches that don’t work or work in a way that lacks common sense (maybe the electrician was drunk?) and a TV in the middle of the mirror that doesn’t work. And be prepared: the oddest thing is the open glass wall between the room and the shower which is awkward. We were there with our daughter and took turns showering while the others left the room or relaxed on the balcony (noticed our neighbor doing the same). Housekeeping staff supervision is not up to the standard of the hotel. The room could have been cleaner - there was hair on floor in bath (a bit gross), the carpet was not vacuumed and it was dirty behind the toilet door which showed prolonged lack of attention to detail. Also, as someone else mentioned, there were light bulbs out that needed to be replaced, in our case 2 out of 3 in the hanging fixture by the bed. Despite the negatives, I think we would stay here again. The staff is lovely and I am confident that they will take feedback into account to correct the housekeeping situation.","March 19, 2018","21    Kaskades South Beach

1228,"We were very dissapointed during our stay at the Kaskades at Gale South Beach. From check-in to check-out we did not get the service that you would expect from a small boutique style hotel that it sells itself as. We had to make certain simple requests 2 or 3 times and still some were not acted upon. Being at the Kaskades also made you feel like 2nd class guests as a number of things were not looked after including the fact that nearly every time we visited the rooftop pool there was no towels to use for the guests. This was another trip to the reception desk which garnered absolutely no response from the team and led to us and other guests just using towels from our room which is far from ideal. The only saving grace was that the location of the hotel is excellent and within easy reach of the beach, restaurants and shopping. ","February 19, 2018","21    Kaskades South Beach

I had a 1 night stay reward with hotels.com so did some research to find the best buy because it only covers $155 then the rest is on you. I saw a deal at the Gale hotel and went for it. Check in was smooth and we were told we would be staying at the sister property across the street, the Kaskades. The room was modern and sleek with some nice amenities like a rainshower with sauna/steam options, black out curtains, and even a heated fancy toilet. Even though it was a short stay, we made good use of many of the amenities such as the beach club at the Shelbourne, the rooftop pool and full breakfast which was included in our stay. There is also live music every night at the Gale so entertainment is footsteps away. We didn't get a chance to use the complimentary car service within a 5 mile radius or the menin perks which offers various deals like discounts and spas and free drinks at bars but we'll be back to try.

The Kaskade felt more like a service flat to me. Breakfast was in a simple meeting type room. Usually I get that kind of breakfast at cheap hotels. Not really match with the idea that the Kaskade wants to offer. The free drinks bar is nice and has a good sselection. Missed the mixers like Tonic to the gin at the mini bar in the room.

1240,"Kaskades, which is under the ownership of The Gale, is a very nice, trendy hotel on Collins Ave. The rooms are spacious, nicely appointed in a modern style, large King Bed, separate toilet, bath and shower area in a glass enclosure, and a balcony. Room is high tech controlling the lights, toilet w heated seat & built in bidet, shower, drapery and so on.Staff was very friendly and tried to accommodate requests or resolve issues promptly. At the time of my visit, it was shortly after the recent hurricane, they were having electrical and computer issues so the hi-tech room could be challenging, irregular phone service, some things worked others, like the temp control for the shower , didn't. But, I know it will get fixed and these issues should not be issues any more.Housekeeping could of been more on the ball and timely.Overall a nice small hotel at the center of South Beach, close to Lincoln Rd., Ocean Drive and Spanish Way.

From the time we were checking in the ladies were so engaged and so ready to help us find the perfect room to celebrate my bday. They were smiling, friendly and was just sooo ready to help us. Rimez was soooo amazing. She gave us a nice complimentary drink by the pool bar to enjoy my bday and the other two ladies Emily and Ouarda were also there making sure we were set. They gave us, my husband and I a glass of champagne. This was not our first time there because we’ve had lunch there but never actually stayed but we are glad we stayed. The service by the pool was amazing. Everyone and everything was on point. We loooved our room, the view was incredible, everything was right, our kids joined us at the end and Rimez made sure to give them toys to make them happy. You ladies rock. Can’t wait to go back. You’ve made my bday extra special","July 8, 2019","22    Mondrian South Beach Hotel

1286,I have stayed at many beautiful hotels. This is not a four star hotel this is a zero star hotel. The entire hotel smells like marijuana. It’s like a spring break gone completely wild. The maid put the bed back together but didn’t clean anything else! The bathroom still had dirty towels. Didn’t replace the shampoo and other toiletries. The staff is rude and not accommodating! I am so sick to my stomach that we paid almost $1000 to stay here with our two young children. We won’t even use the amenities $35 /day because I will not allow my kids or myself to be surrounded by such garbage! I’ve had a headache since I’ve been here because the rooms smell and the entire hotel is dirty! Such a shame for such a well known brand. Hotel managers TERRIBLE!

And that wasn’t one group. It was 90%of the people doing that around kids! During the normal day, the pool was already so crowded. The reason I picked this hotel is that I could have a great view for the 4th of July fireworks but on that day I had to leave the hotel as people from outside took over and the place became a hip-hop club. If I wanted to use the pool during the day I had to pay 1k for a cabana or 750 for a sunbed or I could stay for free in a chair without an umbrella in the boiling sun without shade.Poor Mondrian to have his name used in this trash.","July 7, 2019","22    Mondrian South Beach Hotel

My massage was exactly what I wanted and I’m looking forward to booking again soon.,"July 1, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

1323,"This hotel is really an oasis in Miami Beach where you can forget it all and unwind! A few steps in and you already feel the elegance of it through unique fragrance of the place (you can also purchase the same smell candle and enjoy a relaxing moment at your home, like I did :D ). Everything: from healthy food, to great music, nicely furnished rooms and pool with the music under the water! - everything makes you feel just happy and enjoying life! The SPA is amazing! Make sure to order their ""hurts so sweet"" massage - you won't regret it ;) The personnel of the hotel deserves a word on its own! Such curtesy and high standards of service which won't leave you disappointed at any moment! My special thanks to the managers (Sebastien - my always favorite), pool/restaurant servers and all the guys at the valet parking (Ana - thank you!). Guys - you rock!

1325,"I am a spa novice, but decided to splurge on a fancy hotel for my birthday. I went in timid and left a true believer! Vanessa at the spa counter assisted me with selecting a service and products that would best suit my needs. If I got confused when in the spa space, I'd come out and ask her questions and she'd patiently help me out (the scrub room confused me, what can I say). She was so helpful and kind! I had elected to get a Thai massage, and she paired me with Humberto. It was my first Thai massage and I had no idea what to expect - I left feeling like a new person, absolutely euphoric. It's been three days since I've been home, and I'm still feeling the positive effects of my experience.It was storm season so I didn't get to experience the hotel's pools or mud lounge. I love that they have a direct line from the room phone to call congress, as well as a phone booth. Additionally, I appreciated that they provided ear plugs as sound from other guests passing my room was kind of loud (maybe the only negative, but not a big enough deal to me to detriment a star), reminders to mind water consumption, and options to keep sheets when housekeeping comes through to conserve associated water waste of daily fresh sheets. Additionally, there is a (fancy) grocery store and nice restaurants in walking distance. I loved my experience at the Standard and look forward to visiting again.","June 22, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

The pool is beautiful overlooking the bay, the entire hotel is whimsical with various gardens and private areas to relax in, the restaurant has solid food and drinks, and the spa was great! Shout out to Vanessa and Amaya for being so helpful with our spa experience. They were absolutely great - very fun and friendly, which was very refreshing from the typical serious tone most have at a spa. Wish we had had more time to enjoy the spa, as there are so many areas to explore! Also, we stayed in a suite, and the outdoor bathtub was truly heavenly. The room itself was very clean and simple - very European in style. Great for cooling off after a long day in the sun. The hotel restaurant had delicious food and fairly good drinks, but the wait staff could be a little slow. If you sit at the bar, though, the service was superb!

1337,"I have been sitting poolside for over an hour and tried to get the attention of the poolside staff to get something to drink and eat, and the staff are useless!! Yesterday was no different. They walk past you, and literally look through you with a painful look on their faces, doing their best to avoid eye contact. I have no idea who they think you are waving at if you wave... Have I missed a trick?The rest if the hotel is lovely. The staff in the restaurant were friendly and catered to a single female traveller with warmth. The menu is fabulous, and I love the fresh juices. The check in desk were friendly, so no complaints there. The facilities of the hotel are gorgeous. It has a Mexico or Bali feel about it. The hammocks in the garden and firepit are a nice touch. It's not a huge area, but very well utilized.I am yet to visit the spa, but will do so and by looking at the reviews, I dare say it will only be amazing! The rooms are lovely, fresh and have an airy feel about them. The bed squeaks badly in my room, so I thank my luck for being a single traveller or I have no doubt there would be numerous compaints. Bathrooms are great with lots of lights and mirrors... girls need mirrors, and guys, the mini bar is well stocked!Overall.. as per the hotel promo, the only celebrity here is me, and yes, I love it, but really am disappointed with the poolside staff, especially as tipping is a custom here. Tips given are purely out of pity, sorry, but zero for attentiveness!! I love that it is dog friendly, and that it is child free. I assume that isn't by chance, and a great move on behalf of the hotel. Also noted they are opening in London. I will check that out later in the year or early next.Enjoy, Miami!I am a frequent world traveller.

1340,"This was my first time visiting Belle Island, what a treat. The weather could only be described as moderately warm at best, the star treatment we received on there hand was sizzlingly good. As we chilled by the pool, after finishing our very tasty Chicken Clubs, it was time to take a dip in the Ice pool, then the waterfall jacuzzi, well I thought it was time for this until I realised that I had forgot my swimming trunks! Not to worry of course, within 10 minutes 2 two separate members of staff had brought over a pair of trunks each! I chose the pink coloured shorts and took the plunge. Consequently, if it wasn't for spare swimming trunks, my disruptive free day at the glorious spa would just not have been the same. For sure, some of the most kind, helpful service I have ever received. Myself and friend felt totally comfortable all day! Other highlights, include the boat-cycle ride along the bay harbour and ending our day, gathered cosily around the fire pit watching the stars finally come out as the clouds fled. Loved it all, would rather be there than London (I live in London) thats for sure!Many thanks again all.Ben ","May 26, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

From top to bottom the customer service level was second to none, it felt as if I was being waited on hand and foot throughout the hotel! I spent a day by the pool, in the outdoor food/bar area & in the spa. By the pool you have the wonderful view of the sea whilst relaxing pool side, it was quite amazing! The pool manager and other members of his team made sure our drinks were constantly full, as well as asking us if there was anything we needed bringing food and extra towels to our loungers! We were even invited to take part in some water sports activities in the sea, we took this opportunity and rode what I can only describe as a water bike around next to some of Miami beaches biggest boats it was a surreal opportunity to which I am very thankful to the general manager and activity leader for sorting out for us! The spa was the perfect relaxation point to take away all of the stress I had! The spa had everything you could ask for, spending around 2 hours in there I came out feeling refreshed and revitalised! In the evening we had food in the outdoor bar. Sat looking out at Miami Beach and the lights of the various buildings and boats it made for a scenic setting, with the moon piercing the clear sky and all the light reflecting back off the sea it felt as if I was in a romantic movie setting! The was a variety of choice in the food we tried a few different options sharing most in order to try as much as possible and I have to say the food was brilliant! I wasn’t sure what to expected from and outdoor bar area but it really held its own for food!

Plenty of little nooks and crannies to retreat to if you want quiet time to read a book, including two double wide hammocks and cabanas around a fire pit. A special shoutout to Oscar, the manager of the the pool area. If I was trying to adjust my lounge chair, Oscar was suddenly there to help. If we needed two lounge chairs in the shade and all seats were taken, Oscar magically made two appear for us. Was the sun creeping up on our feet? Oscar moved the umbrella before we noticed. Free drink samples? But of course. In short, Oscar made regular hotel guests feel like VIPs. When he wasn’t helping us, he was cheerfully finding lost sunglasses, grabbing buoys for incoming boaters and various and sundry things to make guests happy. The overall vibe is international and a bit hipster. The hotel is a scenic 10 minute walk to Sunset Harbor which has a coffee shop and a variety of nice restaurants. After surveying some of the South Beach options including the Delano during our trip, we’ll be coming back to the Standard. Highly recommended!","April 22, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

1359,"I had the opportunity to go to the Lido Spa while I was in Miami last weekend and I received the best deep tissue massage I’ve ever had by Susana Freire. I definitely recommend Standard Spa, and I definitely recommend that you request Susana! She made my experience so enjoyable, so relaxing, and I felt so good after my massage. The bath, the sauna, and the pool were a really great way to relax after Susana did her thing. I don’t think I would’ve been so stoked on Standard had it not been for her. The Standard is a MUST the next time you’re in Miami.","April 19, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

1360,"I have stayed at The Standard previously, but wanted to leave a review about my most recent visit at the end of March because the experience and attention from the staff was so exceptional. I had initially planned on just visiting for the day to spend it by the spa/pool with a friend to celebrate a personal milestone, but we had such a lovely time by the pool (shout out to Milton, who was friendly and very helpful) that we ended up deciding to stay for the night and treat ourselves to a mini staycation. Sales Associate Chris L. made this happen seamlessly: he coordinated the arrangements with the front desk and was super attentive to our needs -- he even had a complimentary bottle of wine sent to the room afterwards! Jorge S. at the front desk made check-in a breeze and showed us the room beforehand to confirm that we liked it (he totally hooked it up with a Bath Terrace Medium room -- perfection). As someone who is from Miami -- a city with so many options for hotel experiences -- The Standard is my go-to for a welcoming and relaxing staycation, and the staff are a huge part of why it's so special.","April 17, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

1362,Going to the standard spa miami was one of the best experiences I've ever had. From the great staff to the amazing drinks and food. Those frozaes are to die for. I went to enjoy the spa and the pool. Approaching the spa on the third floor to get my robe I was kindly greeted by Cintia who had the most amazing attitude and actually looked like she wanted to be there. She then directed me to the locker rooms where I changed and went to enjoy an amazing scrub with my boyfriend. From there I wanted to go take a dip in the pool and came to find myself with Rebecca who gave me a few details about their membership plans. I really enjoyed myself and my boyfriend and I are really considering a signing up for a membership the next time we go.,"April 16, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

1363,"If I could create the perfect hotel, it would look a lot like The Standard. Low background music, chill crowd, pets allowed, no little kids, no cell phone use and plenty of umbrellas alone makes for a great pool day. But the added bonus of being on the bay, with sunset views, a plunge pool and jacuzzi, nooks and crannies where you can lie down by a fire pit, or swing in a hammock, makes the experience that much more cozy and enjoyable. And the spa! The hammam is the best in town. Just lying on the hot marble leads to complete relaxation, and you can enjoy the steam room and sauna for even more detoxing. This is my hands down favorite getaway in Miami. I could stay there forever.","April 15, 2019","23    The Standard, Miami

Asked to move room and moved to larger corner room.-Larger corner room had a random audible ""buzzer"" sound (like the Britain's got talent buzzer!) mostly audible in the bathroom but also the bedroom.

1392,"The hotel is located walking distance from various restaurants and Ocean drive.We just needed a one night stay before going to our condo, so we chose a ""cheap"" hotel in an area where we could walk around at night and explore. South Beach hotels are not exactly cheap in price, even for a The hotel itself is outdated and dreadfully icky. I touched the bathroom wall to hold myself up when I slipped on the bathroom rug, and the wall was so sticky that my hand stuck to it! I contemplated cutting my hand off but I decided it is instrumental to my every day life. I just refuse to think about what in the world was on that wall.The night stay price included free breakfast, but after touching that wall there was no way I would be eating anything in that hotel.The rooms are small, towels are yellowish (no longer white), carpet is badly stained.The shower door fell on top of me when I tried to close it. I had to yell for my husband's help.The rooftop pool looked pretty decent but we did not partake.The elevator is probably the slowest one I have ever encountered. We were on the second floor so we just took the stairs while we were there.Service was mediocre. My husband is a Hilton Gold member, ( I am a Marriott girl myself) and probably will not advance in status if this is the type of property and service the HIlton has to offer. We did not receive a snack or bottled water as usual. I wouldn't have eaten the snacks anyway, I was just too grossed out about that place.Check out was at 10am but we called requesting a 12pm checkout and also requested the same on the online app. When we got back to the room after brunch to pick up our luggage, our keys had been de-activated. We had to go back to the reception to get a new key and no apologies from the front desk.That was annoying.I would never stay there again nor would I recommend it.","March 8, 2019","24    Hampton Inn Miami South Beach - 17th Street

1396,"Checked in on app day prior, chose an available room. Arrived prior to check in, told no rooms ready- which was understandable as we were a little early. At check in time, still no room. An hour past check in, still no room. Blame was placed on “computer system being down” and being unable to communicate with housekeeping staff. Due to severity of issue (guests not being able to check in), we thought a management presence would have been appropriate. In the very least to support staff and possibly assist in communicating with the housekeeping staff (the hotel is only 4 floors with a limited number of rooms). Nothing world ending, but it put a damper on things as the kids missed a big chunk of sunny beach time. When we did get into our room, it smelled heavily of Lysol and strong cleaners and our hand towels were dirty (covered in hairs). Finally I complained (politely) and was given discounted rate on room. Hopefully just a glitch in how things usually go at this hotel, usually we have a great experience at Hampton Inn.

The hotel staff were welcoming and friendly! Each time we walked through the door, they checked in with us. The hotel is close to Ocean Drive and the Lincoln Road mall which both have many restaurants. The downside to this hotel, is that there is only one elevator, and it is relatively small. With that said, there are only four floors, and there are stairs. The pool itself is small, and there are maybe four to six sun loungers around the pool with additional chairs and clustered seating. It is a nice relaxing place to sit, but at times hard to find a place to sit. I am not sure when the pool bar is open, but with Walgreens a block away, we were able to take care of our own drinks.

1400,"What a great little hotel. We arrived at the hotel around 10 a.m. and check-in wasn't officially until 4 p.m. They advised us we could grab breakfast a Maxine's just up the block. There were a group of 3 rooms. We had a nice breakfast and arrived back at the hotel just shy of 11:30 a.m. and one of the rooms was ready. The couple that wanted a room closer to the lobby took the room with a king bed. The other two rooms waited about an hour. The room was comfortable and inviting. Since we had been up since 1 a.m. traveling, we took a nap. Then we wondered off for a quick snack, checked out Miami-South Beach and then a short walk. The front desk staff was fantastic! We chose the hotel for the close proximity to the Miami Cruise terminal. It has a lovely front porch where you could just people watch all day. Which we did both day and night. There are many high-end hotels with all the bells and whistles across the street but this hotel suited just fine as it had a nice breakfast the following morning.","February 4, 2019","24    Hampton Inn Miami South Beach - 17th Street

1403,"How to tell a hotel is clean: all the bedspreads are amazingly white (almost as if they're flexing their top-notch cleanliness!). From the flower-scented hallways to the hygienic practices in the refreshment area, the Hampton Inn is notably sanitary. The receptionists were always amiable and willing to help, and same for the cleaning staff. The breakfast is simple but the waffles machine was fun for our kids. There is not much seating provided in the lobby for breakfast, and it becomes crowded around 9am.

1405,I like the Hampton Inn chain. My husband and I stay there as our first choice when we can. This hotel has great beds and pillows which is consistent with the quality of this hotel chain. I found the hotel seemed a little tired to me and in need of a face lift. The rooms are wheel chair accessible with wide doorways and bathrooms that appear to be built for wheel chairs.

The staff is friendly and helpful, the small bar is well stocked with a friendly bartender and the rooftop pool and deck is a perfect place to relax. The classic front porch of the smaller Art Deco hotels was preserved and is a great place for breakfast and people watching. There is not the glam or glitz of some of the bigger hotels, but the location cannot be beat. Right at a free trolley stop and walking distance to Lincoln road and multiple fine restaurants I could not recommend it any higher.

1409,"We reserved in advance for NYE and got a good price. The hotel looks great from the outside and the location is awesome. The small staff are amazing and seem to really work well together. The breakfast area was always clean and the food was very fresh and tasty. The room, however is where I have a problem. It is sooooo tiny! The bathroom door doesn't open all the way because it hits the tiny sink. The sink doesn't have enough space for basic lotion, hand towel, hair products, etc. If you are a larger sized person, you will not be able to move in the bathroom. If you have lots of hair and makeup products, you will not be auble to use this bathroom. There is no overhead lighting but the lights on the side of the bed and the huge window keep it bright. The giant A/C unti just blows down on you so it affected my husband's allergies. I'm not sure how often the filter is changed or maybe it is the closeness to the bed that makes it blow down on us so hard. We turned the fan down but it is just the way it is made. We were never hot; except in the bath. no vent so if you close the door, you can't use the mirror. The shower was big but you had to get in it to turn it on. Though it is new, the cheap bathroom door and cabinetry are already chipped. No fridge in our room.I would only stay here if I had a great rate and nothing else was available. If it weren't for the amazing staff and convenient lication, I would rate this tiny hotel lower.","December 31, 2018","24    Hampton Inn Miami South Beach - 17th Street

1418,"We were a group of 7, needing 3 rooms for just one night. Came to Miami (first time for all of us) for a cruise, but wanted to stay somewhere near the Art Deco area so we could at least get a glimpse of it before we sailed. This hotel fit the bill. It was the most reasonably priced place we could find (still pretty pricey, though!) and the location seemed nearly ideal. Right in the midst of shopping, fancy hotels, nice restaurants, the Soundscape park and more. And just a short walk to the Art Deco area.I've stayed at my fair share of Hampton Inns, but this place was a little different. For one thing, the exterior of the building actually had some style or design aesthetic. We were all VERY pleasantly surprised. Lovely front porch area, lovely lobby. The front desk service was very friendly and speedy. We did briefly avail ourselves of the bar that evening...expensive but fairly friendly service. The rooms were nice as well. Not huge by any stretch, but well appointed. Everything worked, the water was hot, the bed nice and I have no complaints. Minor issues: the elevator is tiny and slow. REALLLLLLLLY slow! And the only stairs are a long way away from the lobby, so that's not a reasonable option to taking the elevator. But I'd sure recommend the place, based on my shopping experience. While not on the beach...it's close. And again, the price was the best we could find for something in this category. You could do much, much worse.","November 28, 2018","24    Hampton Inn Miami South Beach - 17th Street

You an walk to the beach and the restaurants on Ocean Drive or sit on the porch facing Collins Avenue and watch the world walk by. You WILL see the world walk by.

1422,"First off I want to start by saying I used to live literally one block from this hotel, and passed it walking to work every single day. Now that I live in North Florida this is the place we chose to stay for a mini honeymoon. I’ve only ever seen the front until this weekend and it is amazing. There is a beautiful, quaint little pool right in the middle of the facility. There’s only about 10 rooms so it’s super intimate and the staff is around when you need them but not in your face. They literally leave around seven or 8 PM and everything is self check in after that. They also have a perfect little sized breakfast in the morning with bagels, muffins, cereal, drink pretty much anything you need for a good little start to your morning if you don’t want to spend $50 on breakfast. Lastly the room was clean and pretty. Also I was just the perfect size for two people the shower was a little small but it’s South Beach, so the buildings are older.

1423,"Stood here for two nights from Aug 22-24 & the place was great to us. The room is more of an apartment style. Small/ decent sized pool in the middle of the premises. A breakfast/ coffee included during the morning. The owner usually closes the door to the main entrances so don’t be alarmed if she doesn’t come out right away. Good location walking distance to all the shops, beaches and attractions although we rented a car prior to checking into this hotel. A couple of cons 1) there is no parking provided so you gonna have to pay to park your car AFTER 6pm & don’t risk it, Miami will tow it away from what we’ve heard from others from around the neighborhood! Go to the publix parking lot it’s about 15mins walking but they charge the cheapest. $20 for 24hrs of parking compares to $30 a day at other garages . 2) don’t expect any extra cleaning to the room or for maintenance. If you need toilet paper or additional towels you gonna have to ask for it. Other than that that the hotel will do you well, enjoy!","August 26, 2018","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

Not a good idea). Besides, earlier when I saw one of the group partiers (while using the bathroom) and asked them to keep the noise down, all I got was ""we'll do whatever we want. We paid for our room too""... They practically threatened me. That's when I called to complain.4-The hotel description never mentioned the bathroom would be shared.5-Lots of smoking by the pool when I went to heat up some food in the microwave (that's where it's at).While I didn't enjoy the stay at all, and didn't sleep all night, I will be fair and mention some good parts about the place for this to be a complete review.1-The room was very clean2-Room temp was pleasant3-The front desk/owner was very nice and greeted me nicely, but not very helpful after the mentioned problems started.I finished writing this at 246am because I can't sleep anymore at this hotel after all the noise issues. I'm too stressed out. I may consider removing this review with a full refund so I can forget about this experience.","November 14, 2017","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

My favorite place to stay in Miami, I have stayed here on vacation and for business multiple times and love the location, the smaller personalized atmosphere and quiet times by the pool. The location is excellent, it is in the heart of South Beach but just far enough away from the tourism and noise. The rooms are clean and have a modern style to them. This is a magical oasis in Miami, I will continue to stay here when I visit Miami. The management is friendly and always available to go above and beyond to ensure my stay is pleasant....Love to the SOBE You team!!","July 1, 2017","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

1445,This attractive hotel is clean small and quiet within a short walking distance of South Beach and public transport. The continental breakfast was basic but sufficient. It would be nice if coffee could be made available all day as there were no coffee facilities in the room. The room had a fridge and a good size television with limited channels. The bed was large and very comfortable. There were comfortable chairs outside our room which overlooked the pool. There were also several sunbeds around the clean small swimming pool.The reception staff were welcoming but only available until around 8pm in the evening. The lady serving breakfast is fairly solemn but I think that is because she spoke limited English.The rooms were a good size and there was no noise at night apart from on one occasion when younger guests sat around the pool chatting and playing music until 2am. I would stay at this hotel again. It was good value and in a very good location.,"March 16, 2017","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

A longer walk to restaurants and shops at Lincoln Road Mall. If you don't want to walk, Uber will pick you up in less than 2 minutes. The B&B consists of the main house with.2 rooms upstairs sharing a bath. There is also a larger room upstairs with a private bath, king size bed & a separate room with 2 single beds. It is very comfortable and roomy. The deco was ""early Hollywood"" which my wife liked, I thought it was glitzy, but as long as it is clean and comfortable, I don't care if it is Beverly Hillbillies. At the back of the property there are 7 different size rooms sort of like old mom & pop motels. All clean and comfortable. We have seen one and stayed in one.

You are not going to do lengths but when you have returned from the beach or sightseeing it's great to lie on a lounger under a parasol that doesn't cost anything (unlike the outrageous prices on Miami beach) and go in to cool off. The rooms are fine, have air con and fans. Beds are very comfortable and the sheets are good quality. We had a suite of bedroom and living room which was great.

1454,"Stayed at Sobe You B&B with my friend during a layover back to NYC. Our room overlooked the pool. We didn't realize we got the room that had the shared bathroom, so imagine our surprise when we were wondering where the hell our bathroom was and then realized it was not IN the room - ____ - For it to be a shared bathroom, it could've and should be in MUCH better shape. I'm sooo glad I was only there for less than 24 hours. The bathtub didn't drain fast at all, thus you had to wait for the water to go down. Same with the sink. There weren't many places to put your items, like your soap, etc. When we were checking in, there was a lady cleaning the bathroom. We stepped in to check it out probably about 10 minutes after she left, and I honestly don't know what she did.There weren't many outlets in the room to charge your devices. I had to use my portable charger. AC didn't work - had to open all the windows, which helped a bit.When we returned from dinner later that night, we arrived to a barking dog in the room next to us. I just prayed that he wouldn't be up the entire night doing that smh. This space was OK for the overnight.

The guy that checked us in on 8-12-16, barely looked up from his cell phone to acknowledge us.. Walked us to our room.. No instructions on breakfast, where to get ice, pool towels, bicycles (sitting here looking at them and wondering what the policy is..can we use them..is there a locks that we would need ). ..and what about the area..any good places to not miss? We ask questions.. Met with - you are bothering me replies.. No info in the rooms. Where is the special touch that almost all B&Bs give??

Check-in was unfriendly and impatient. The bathroom was small and need renovations - as last year, but a defect toilet lid should simply be exchanged. Last year there were David the owner, nice friendly and helpful - this year I missed him, maybe that was the reason for all this …I’m not sure if I come back next year.Conclusion: currently it is no longer worth a high price.","May 4, 2016","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

Also, I never got to thank the housekeeper that found my phone in the bed right before we got in our taxi, THANK YOU! I see some of the reviewer complaints about checking in late and no one being there to greet them. People they are a B&B not a big hotel corporation, they also have families they want to get home to at night. They make it easy for you to check in even if they have gone for the day. They have a locked gate that you can access with your key to leave in and out and they have cameras, felt really safe there.

1464,"We decided to do a quick trip to Florida arriving 2/21 and departing on 2/27. On February 17th, I reserved one night at the Sobe You B&B for February 25th. On the night of the 24th, my husband came down with a respiratory flu with a fever of 103.5. We were in the Florida Keys and I was able to find a physician that could see him; he was prescribed 3 medications and we were told he would be very ill for at least two more days and that we would not be able to fly home on the 27th. At 8:14 a.m., I called the Sobe You & spoke with Raul; I apologized and explained the situation and he said we probably would not get a refund. We later received an e-mail confirming that. I replied explaining that my husband was too ill to travel & offered to send them the note from the doctor that we had to give the airlines to reschedule a later flight. I did not get a reply. On 2/27, I called again, this time talking with Kadi. I asked if they had received my e-mail and she said she'd check later; I had not given my name yet & so I asked her if that wouldn't be required. She said to re-send the e-mail which I did. It is now 3/2 & I still have not received a reply. I completely understand the issues with last-minute cancellations and the non-refund policies but since this is a situation beyond our control, I would expect at the least an offer to use the money at a later date. We lost $234.36 on this for an event that was not our choice. If we could have travelled we would have been at the Sobe. In the conversation with Raul, he stated they require a 30-day cancellation; I pointed out that would have been difficult since the reservation had only been made the prior week. Due to their poor policies & the lack of a response, I would encourage others to stay at any other place than this B&B.","March 2, 2016","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

Having stayed here before in September 2014, we picked this hotel specifically and were really looking forward to our stay. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations or our previous visit. Upon arrival, the front door and side doors of the property were locked and we received no answer to the doorbell, however we were able to enter via the side gate. The owner was on the property, and took us to reception however it became very clear that he was unsure of the day-to-day running of the establishment. He was unable to correctly process our credit card, and had no paperwork for us. When we asked for a parking permit to allow us to park on the road outside, the owner was unable to find one – we eventually had to pay $50 for a 24-hour ticket in a nearby lot 5 blocks away. It transpires that the previous manager (David) has left suddenly within the last few days… what a difference! The pool area and surrounding paths (previously spotless) were covered in dead palm leaves and the pool itself had debris under water on the pool floor. Further, the pool was cold (far too cold to use), which was a real disappointment as this was one of the main reasons we chose to return to SoBe You. Further, our room (no. 2) was on the ground floor (despite our request for an upper floor) and had an incredibly old and noisy air-conditioning unit. We made the most of our stay, enjoying a walk on South Beach, and a night out in Miami. Breakfast next morning was equally disorganised, with no hot water available for tea/coffee, too few yoghurts, and milk that was off. We knew we’d be returning after our 4-day trip to Key West, so specifically asked for a different room (on an upper floor with quiet AC), asked for the pool temperature to be increased, and asked that they ensure we had a parking permit. We were really disappointed on our return 4 days later to find that we had been given another ground floor room (no.3, albeit with a modern AC unit), that the pool was still too cold to use, and that rather than being given a parking permit, we were given a map to a $15 multi-storey car park several blocks away. Further, there was no management available on the property, with our “instructions” and key left for us in the post-box. Again, we made the most of our stay in Miami, and enjoyed some terrific food and drinks at the nearby 11th Street Diner. Breakfast next morning was a little better organised, as was checkout. In conclusion, SoBe You was terrific in Sep 2014, but seemed much more run-down in Jan 2016… perhaps this was the reason David suddenly left. For what we paid (around $200 per night), I’m sure there are plenty better options available on Miami South Beach. Disappointed!","January 31, 2016","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

1471,"This B&B is well located a few blocks from the beach and Ocean Drive. You can easily walk there in 10 minutes or take a bike. Nevertheless it is also far away enough from the party zone so that you can find your sleep. The breakfast is good with a huge variety.We were allowed a later checkout to have a shower before heading directly to the airport, this also was quite nice.Nevertheless there are some downsides:- The greeting on our arrival was not very welcoming. We had the impression that the manager was disturbed by us, late checkin envelopes were already prepared although we arrived before the announced checkin time.- The bathrooms are old and need a makeover. There are free shower gels etc. but nobody removed the old stained dispensers, next to rusty unused towel racks... At 250 USD per night we'd think that removing or replacing these items are a must. Size of the rooms is small but that's not the issue.- The overall cleaning is not quite satisfactory (see pictures).- The WiFi is really slow. It was impossible to be online at the same time. The worst WiFi we've had during the entire tripOverall: SoBeYou has potential to be a real gem, but right now, it is too expensive for what you get.","January 14, 2016","25    Sobe You Bed and Breakfast

I was sharing bathroom (i realised after booking). it was ok ... shared with just one other room, as long as you are lucky with the other user ;-) Of course the swimming pool is a plus! and Breakfast is quite alright, good variety of fruits, yogurts, pastries, juice, cheese. And you have it outside , near the pool.

1476,"I felt so strongly about my overpriced/shocking stay at this hotel I have made an account specifically to review it. I stayed here for 4 nights in July with my boyfriend. We chose this hotel as we thought we were getting good quailty for a reasonable price compared to other hotels in the area. However please be aware you have to pay for more or less everything at check out despite being told by front desk staff as “complimentary”. Very overpriced for what you get.Please see below to make yourself aware of additional charges and a list of my unsatisfactory stay:1. On arrival you are expected to pay a deposit of $150 per night (therefore $600 for 4 nights)- we did not know about this beforehand- a bit much for a young couple? Lucky we had a credit card.2. Housekeeping staff knocked on our door x3 times on 2 mornings of our stay. On one occassion the first knock was at 8.30am- not very satisfactory when on holiday. When we complained to front desk they stated the house keeping staff did not start until 9am. My family stayed in the room next door to us and also got a knock at 8.30am3. We got complimentary check out to 12pm as a “good will” for above problem. On check out day the house keeping staff knocked 3 times to ask when we were leaving and the room phone rang from reception at the normal check out time (11am) to remind us to leave. My boyfriend went down to tell them we had a late check out to which they stated they knew about. We felt like such an inconvenience being in the room. 4. My family had a 3 person room however when getting pool chairs/beach chairs its a 2 beds per room policy with additional charges for additional beds- can end up being very costly despite paying resort fee (see below)5. We were hit with a hefty resort fee at check out of $38.76 (including tax) PER NIGHT while staying at this hotel. This added an additional $155 onto our bill which we were not expecting. On the booking summary it only states a single resort fee of around $38 does not say anything about per night. As you can imagine we were fairly shocked by this as we chose this hotel thinking we were getting a good price. We spoke to the female front desk manager (and showed her the documents) about this who stated the resort fee included things like-beach beds-stationary in the rooms-international calls-kickboxing class-kids hip hopWe are aware most hotels charge a resort fee however this hotel and the booking party does not advertise this correctly and front desk staff 100% used the term complimentary upon check in. We feel our right to compare prices between hotels prior to booking has not been transparent. Why not just give us the overall final total? On our booking confirmation it gives us the breakdown of price for all 4 nights with the total then further down resort fee $38.76 to be paid at property. Not clear it is per night. I have read other reviews and know this is not the first time this has happened but the female manager claimed this is the first brought to her attention. We did not use any of these facilities apart from the beach beds on one day (had to pay additional $ for an extra bed anyway). It is a rip off.6. If you want a beach umberella (as most guests do as it is very hot) it is an additional $22 per day7. Car parking (which we knew about) is costly at $46 dollars per night8. On check in the front desk staff are quick to mention all the perks of the hotel such as complimentary beach chairs, sun cream by the pool- but you end up paying for them anyway with resort fee.9. While we found the beds comfortable and AC good, the bathrooms are very very small, with a lot of shimming around to navigate space10. The shower takes around 5 mins to heat up for a warm shower11. The SLS next door was a big problem for us. The hotel blasts music at their weekend pool parties. Can be heard clearly from surfcomber pool and beach- the thud of the music is not very relaxing. I think it should be mentioned more on the hotel website about this and events they may of organised. They held a massive 4th july pool party which closed the pool to guests not wanting to party-no mention of it online or on booking sites.12.Storage space in the rooms is less than adequate. No room for suitcases.I am not writing this review to complain it is to make others aware of what we didnt know. The hotels pool area is nice, we enjoyed swimming here. The pool attendent Juan was very helpful. The pool bar served nice cocktails and was nice enjoying them poolside. The tall male front desk staff was helpful. The lady front desk manager was not very understanding or apologetic. Simply refused to do anything or help us as it was not her problem. Told us to complain to hotels.com instead.  Overall our stay was not good at this hotel. We feel it is very over priced and below standard of other hotels on Collins Avenue. This hotel should be rated at 2.5 star at best. If we had of known what we do now about this hotel we would of booked another better quality hotel on the same strip for the same price as we ended up paying upon check out at surfcomber!Very disappointed with this hotel and will not be back!","July 12, 2019","26    Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel

1477,"My husband and I were scheduled to stay at the Kimpton for a full week beginning July 3. 5 days into the trip we moved hotels up the beach because the music from the surrounding hotels was so loud til midnight every night. If we had to move hotels, then I’m sure you’re wondering why we’ve given the Kimpton 4 stars. I’ll work backwards - Marc, the hotel manager, upon our early check-out, apologized profusely for the noise and instantly offered to refund our last 2 nights. He couldn’t have been nicer or more professional about the situation, which thoroughly impressed us. He also is the spitting image of Von Miller, which we found awesome since we’re Aggies! Seriously, the guy couldn’t have been nicer and his hospitality was a 10/10. We’ve stayed at the Kimpton before, and love the daily complementary happy hour, the nice staff and the location. Prior to this trip we would have said 5 stars on those things alone. Finally, the Kimpton itself had a huge pool party (Vegas style) for July 4, which we didn’t know / wasn’t advertised when we booked the room. Though we had 2 complimentary tickets to the pool party, we stayed away / observed from our balcony. Not our scene - totally okay (and the people watching at this thing was fantastic). But what wasn’t okay was that on July 4, we couldn’t use the pool at all and they’d blocked off all restrooms. So when you were out at the beach you had to walk all the way to the front of the hotel and use the bathrooms in the lobby, which is also what everyone else was doing. Bad logistics for paying hotel guests and party-goers alike. On July 5, we awoke early to the sounds of clanking metal as they deconstructed the stages and DJ equipment, which by the way wasn’t done til about 3p on 7/5. So that bathroom problem I mentioned? Yep still had that same issue all day on the 5th as they put their pool area back together. Point of this review being - if you want to party, this would have been a great set-up for you. I believe the hotel said this was their 15th year of doing the July 4 pool party. If you didn’t want to party, not so much. Also if you stay on a weekend, be prepared for the SLS on the right and the hotel to the left of Marseilles to be bumping alllllllll day and night. Those folks don’t know how to quit, so if you’re looking for relaxation, a weekend at the Kimpton might not be for you. Maybe try for a mid-week stay instead.","July 10, 2019","26    Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel

1496,"As someone who started coming to the Surfcomber over 4 years ago, I am torn. Even though the hotel still has a fantastic pool, clean rooms, and unbeatable beach access, there were some things that left us cold on this visit. First off, the good things. The hotel is a gorgeous little Art Deco boutique hotel about a 10-15 minute walk from the nightlife on Ocean Drive. For those of us who like to get away from the noise, this is a perfect spot. There is a very long bricked boardwalk that parallels the beach that must go for miles in either direction - just right for early morning walks. (There are also complimentary bikes, if you'd prefer to peddle.) On the whole, the front desk folks are very helpful. (When our plane was delayed, the front desk helped our oldest check in on his own so he didn't have to wait in the lobby for us.) The lobby gives off a welcoming vibe and there's always ice cold agua fresca. There's full coffee and tea service set out in the mornings and a complimentary wine bar from 4pm-5pm every night. The seating area outside the hotel provides a great spot to relax and people watch on Collins. (And believe me, the people watching is great!) The rooms and bathrooms are clean, and the pool area, with complimentary towel service, is huge by South Beach standards. You can order drinks and food from your lounge chair or sit under the pergola at the outdoor grill. There is outdoor ping pong, corn hole, and bocci for people, like my husband, who can't stand sitting by the pool for hours at a time. The beach area has complimentary towel and chair service. While you can still order food and drinks from your chair, you now have to use an app. I really miss the personal service that came with raising your own little flag and having one of the hotel staff take your order. The fitness center is small, but who comes to South Beach to work out inside? It had everything we needed, if there had been a bad day where we couldn't get outdoors.Here's where I want to give a shout out to one of the Surfcomber managers, Marc Reid. Marc went above and beyond to make sure that a problem, that had nothing to do with him, was remedied with graciousness and efficiency. When we came to him with our concerns, he recognized the issue, kept us informed, and quickly offered a solution. He's a keeper.And now for the things that left us a little cold. First off, the little details that made this a boutique hotel 4 years ago seem to be missing. The shampoo and bath gel is now dispensed in big squirt bottles. If you want a coffee maker in your room, you have to request it. The air conditioner in our room was very loud, and although our tv was fine, one of our sons said that his tv only got 3 channels. (It was not repaired in the 2 days we were there.) Since IHG has taken over, I may have been expecting more of a Holiday Inn experience, so that's what I got. The main thing that was initially out of the hotel's control, but colored our stay, was an incident that occurred around 11:30pm on our first night. Our three sons heard someone crying for help outside their room. The police were called and our oldest had to provide a statement since he witnessed ""Tanya"" strangling and beating her boyfriend in the hallway. The next morning we brought this up with the manager on duty, Shawnee. She either had no knowledge of the incident or didn't care. (We also reported the broken tv to her.) We asked if there was anything the hotel could do to help make this right with our sons. She offered to provide an additional room at a lower rate, if one became available and took my cell phone number. It was our understanding that she would contact us between 2pm and 3pm to let us know if we could get a room or if we should move our sons to a different hotel. At 4pm, we went to the desk and were told that Shawnee had gone home for the day! We had to start over again with Marc, who was very professional and mindful of our concerns. (Again, give that man a raise!) We realize that the hotel had no control over the domestic incident, but Shawnee's lack empathy and complete disregard of our concerns was mind blowing. Did she really think we'd just forget about it?Finally, when we checked out, I paid for all 3 rooms ($1,600+) on my credit card. Two hours later, my oldest son received an alert from his bank that he'd also been charged over $600 for rooms along with a $300 security deposit. (Having arrived ahead of us, he used his card as the security deposit to check in.) Lucky us, we called and got Shawnee. It's now 4 days since we checked out and the money still has not been credited back.This is a beautiful hotel with so much to offer. I wouldn't let one bad employee keep me away, but it is a pretty steep price tag for Holiday Inn service. While it's not as friendly as in years' past, it's still one of the best places to stay in South Beach.","June 26, 2019","26    Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel

We stayed in one of the two rooms in an out-building in the garden. It was simply furnished but had a great shower.

There was also a 'happy hour' with free wine and snacks every afternoon. Everyone was really friendly.

A very short walk to the beach and nice relaxation area out the back, with a hot tub if you’re in the mood. Generous sized fridge in the room and comfortable bed.

1551,"We booked the king room via airbnb for a Wednesday night in mid June. We got a good price (for Miami Beach). We were greeted by a sweet lady who didn't speak English, but she showed us to our room and let us settle. All of the staff were very nice ms attentive. The room was clean! It smelt like cleaning products which to me was a good sign. At first the room looked five star, but some little things brought it down. There was no cable. There was no trash can. There was no where to put our stuff (bags, keys, purse, etc). There were no outlets to charge phones or plug in a hair dryer. However, the AC was great, the bathroom was big, and the bed was comfy. On our way out to yoga class we met the front desk attendant who was very pleasant. She went over all the details about parking, entry/exit, breakfast, etc. We talked about wanting to use the hot tub on our return and she said she'd turn it on and have wine and cheese for the guests to enjoy. We returned and the hot tub was open but not hot. We turned the heater on and when (an hour later) it was warm we got in. It burned our skin and felt like someone had poured bleach in there. This was very disappointing as the hot tub was the main reason we booked this place :/ There was also no wine in sight. The garden oasis was covered in leaves and there were big bags of trash left in plain view. We woke up the next morning and I went to the kitchen to find coffee. I wish the coffee had been more easily accessible. We waited until 8:30 for them to start offering breakfast but it was nice. We sat outside and the lady took our order. The food was fresh and was a nice surprise. Overall we had a nice stay. If there were a few upgrades (sweep leaves, put trash away, get cable, etc) it could be a five star.","June 25, 2017","27    Bars B&B South Beach Miami

1559,"Stayed for a couple of weekday nights. Reserved trough Expedia and choose this place because the description indicated that parking was included. After a 4 hour ride to get there, we arrived around 7:30p only to be told that there was no parking and that I should have called in advance to reserve a parking spot as they have a limited amount of parking spaces available. I have traveled extensively and this is the first time I have been told this. The staff in charge that night was helpful but it was frustrating trying to explain that nowhere in Expedia it was indicated that I needed to call to reserve a parking spot, in fact it clearly said Free Parking which was the main reason I opted for this place. The person kept pointing out that we needed to park in a nearby garage and never acknowledge what we we just explaining to him. Well, we had no choice but to park in that garage which was around $20 per night. At least we got $20 back for each day that we parked there. Our room was extremely clean with AC, restroom, fridge and a nice welcome note. When we went to the bathroom there was no light and the shower was clogged but it was already late (because of all the parking hassle), so we decided to report this next day. Breakfast starts at 8:30a which is a bit late if you want to have an early start, but the service was good as well as the food. The lights in our restroom were fixed next day in the afternoon but the shower remained clogged for our whole stay. The beach is about a 15 minute walk and there is a grocery store a block and a half away, which is where we parked our car. The patio area is nice but smoking is allowed, so we were not able to enjoy at full, for instance, we were going to have our breakfast outside but a couple that arrived after us sat in a nearby table and started smoking, we waited but it was pretty nasty so we decided to have breakfast inside, a shame as it was a beautiful morning perfect for breakfast al fresco. All in all, we paid $159 per night (too much for what we got) and again the description of the property indicates that parking is available so if this is not accurate it should be corrected immediately as we would have stayed in a different place if we knew about the parking situation.","November 6, 2016","27    Bars B&B South Beach Miami

All white and silver decor very stylish, fitted with probably the best efficient air con unit we have encountered.Breakfast is served in the garden there is also indoor seating available, excellently presented and prepared by very friendly staff.On checking in we were given excellent information about all things South Beach with places to visit and eat discussed. In fact every member of staff we encountered were helpful and engaging. The only thing that this place could benefit from if it had the space would be an outdoor pool however it does offer a jacuzzi in the garden and also provides beach towels and other beach accessories if needed.

1568,"If you are into a small clean room near south beach and you don't mind spending 250 each night then this ur spot. Be warned that 6ou will be charged an extra 5% just for using your credit card. The pros are that you receive free parking which is a great $30 value. You do get a breakfast consisting of orange juice, coffee, parfait with plain yogurt, and your choice of 1 pancake or a super small omelette. Afterwards the same person that serves you breakfast cleans your room which I found odd but to be expected at a b&b. The worst part was not being able to control the temperature of your room. If u like the room temp to fluctuate between 60 and 75 degrees then this is your hotel. I liked the out door jacuzzi which was only on during one of our nights. I also liked the evening wine hour between 6-7. That was nice as well. Do I think it is worth 250 a night? No way jose.

1572,"Bars B&B is a renovated home in a quiet neighborhood that is well away from Ocean Ave. It is a within easy walking distance of the action and the beach (less than a half mile away). This boutique hotel is very quaint and attractively decorated. The hosts and employees were all extremely warm and friendly and helpful. Some of them speak rather limited English, so that can present a challenge at times (for non-Spanish speaking guests). But all of them are absolutely trying to be helpful. The rooms are small, but very nice. Everything is spotlessly clean. The beds appear to be double beds, so they are rather small for an adult couple. The mattress cover is some kind of easily compressed foam. If you are a stomach sleeper, it may not be so comfortable. On your back, it was good. It definitely is a soft mattress (on the spectrum from soft to firm). The breakfast in the morning was really delicious. It consisted of a first course of fresh fruit, then eggs prepared to your choice (scrambled, fried, etc.), and then a pancake. Everything was excellent. There is not much sound insulation in the walls. Although you are in a quiet neighborhood, where street noise is not much of an issue, you do hear sounds from elsewhere in the B&B (toilet flushing, someone in the lobby area, etc.). On balance, however, all of the negatives are minor. It is a warm and friendly place with great hosts. And, perhaps most of all, it is a really good value for an overnight stay in Miami Beach.","February 11, 2016","27    Bars B&B South Beach Miami

1578,"My husband and I booked an overnight stay at Bars B&B South Beach Hotel. The hotel is gorgeous! The bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean and beautiful. It had modern decor. Charlie was very friendly and very helpful. I enjoyed a glass of wine and cheese and crackers after returning from the beach. The breakfast the next morning was amazing! We started with coffee, toast and a fruit plate after that we were asked to order eggs pancakes omelette whatever we wanted! Food was delicious! The entire staff was outstanding and went above and beyond! The service was truly exceptional! The outside garden is just beautiful with a hot tub to enjoy if you chose.

Carlos made us feel most welcome, and gave us some interesting information and two glasses of wine each!! Breakfast was excellent and we ate outside in the glorious garden, truly amazing. The whole place has a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, truly a special team. We will stay here again if we visit Miami in the future.

The staff were incredibly nice, and even baked fresh brownies for everyone daily. The free breakfast was awesome and consisted of orange juice, coffee, a fresh fruit plate and your choice of either eggs or pancakes (both of which were delicious!). The one lady at the front desk, I believe her name was Teris was so nice and helpful. We went to the affiliated hostel to go out one night and they offered free cocktails.

1582,"We stayed here for one night in Miami and we only wish we had more time!Firstly, when we arrived (earlier than check in) we were given the option of having a room in the B&B or an apartment nearby, depending on which would suit us with the car. We opted for the room in the B&B after seeing how beautifully decorated it was.We were offered cold lemonade or wine to drink, and they kept our luggage for us while we went to the beach. We were given beach towels to take and they also helped us out with getting a parking place.When we came back they greeted us like we had known them forever, it was really nice. Our room was perfect, nicer than some of the expensive hotels we had stayed in. It was really clean and we were given bathrobes and fresh fluffy towels.We went on the night out arranged by the sister Hostel to this (Miami International). A taxi was arranged for free to take us to the hostel so that we could join the night out. We had a great night out, for $20 it was free drinks at the hostel, a rooftop bar, party bus then VIP room in a club.When we woke up for breakfast the next morning, we were offered pancakes, omelette, fresh juice, fruit, yoghurt, whatever we wanted.We also used the hot tub which was great after a day of walking around.When we checked out they couldn't have been more friendly, they made sure we still had beach towels to enjoy our day and we were able to leave the car there until we were back. Again, when we came back we were free to use the facilities, have a drink, use the outside shower etc. It was just a perfect stay, with probably the best service we experienced during our whole trip to the USA.Thanks so much for such a good time - we will be recommending to anyone who wishes to stay in Miami and we will hopefully be visiting again.","July 17, 2015","27    Bars B&B South Beach Miami

Everythings is new there so be sure that everythings is very clean and bedrooms are very beautifull and trendy. The must are the employees who are so nice and always very helpful for everythings, they make all for you can be confortable during your stay.The atmosphere is great, you can feel very relax and really like you are in vacation. There is a jacuzzi and little space where you can stay and enjoy the moment. The breakfast is awesome, fruits, pancakes, toasts, coffee orange Juice, omelet, all is made home and they ask you what you want. I been there with my family and we had an amaizing time there, and felt like we was home.You feel very in security because there is lot of cameras outside. Top of that, it is very close to the beach and the downtown of miami beach. It is definitely better than an hotel, because you not feel close in a room, it is really like a cute little house with awesome services.Thanks you very much !","June 21, 2015","27    Bars B&B South Beach Miami

The parking charges are absolute extortion but not out of step with the rest of the city, and there’s a resort fee which I’m never cool with - just build it into the cost and be done with it.The reception and breakfast area are really small. There’s a little bar attached at the side which is also tiny but cute however the cocktails are awful, I tried three different ones and they were really poor.The room was comfortable and clean and I couldn’t have asked for anything else from a two night stay.

We especially liked the possibility of using the free sun beds on the beach, just a few blocks away.The rooms were spacious and modern with comfortable beds.The service of this hotel is exceptional. We had never experienced such level of service anywhere else in the US.Overall - by using this hotel, you get value for money.If we should be pointing at some improvements:The rooms have quite small windows. We tried both the queen size room and king size room. There is basically no difference except for the bed size - despite the cost difference. But we liked having rooms located inside - not towards the street.The cleaning of the room is good - but - they did not change the bed sheets for four days and the bed side tables were always standing far away from the bed after they had been cleaning the room.The towels had occasionally some spots and dirt on them when we got them - both for the room towels and the beach towels.The pool and pool area is limited to a very small area.","June 12, 2019","28    Urbanica The Meridian Hotel

It has a European chill vibe to it and during check in you get a free drink, which was really good. The hotel provides you with bicycles which we used a lot, since everything was short distance from the hotel, including ocean drive, and the beach. Our room also had a great smell to it, everything was very clean and nice. There is a minibar, very cute and classy. Every staff member made us feel very welcomed and at home, but I will say our favorite was definitely Luis who works the front desk. The pool and pool area is also very nice, with lounges. No the hotel is not right next to the beach, but you still get beach lounges and towels. Our flights were before and after the check in and check out times and they were nice enough to hold our bags.

You can also help yourself to coffee anytime.The room was well appointed and clean and the one thing that sticks out at me about the hotel is that it smells really nice with a lovely fragrance.The pool all be it small was ideal and a chill out room next to it along with a vending machine and ice/water machines.We didn’t get chance to have our free cocktails and free bike rental but again some nice touches.

On our last day, we were allowed to use a room to take a shower and get dressed before leaving to the airport, which was a very nice service.Only thing we could complain about is the rather thin walls of our room and the fact that you cannot conrol the AC apart from turning it on and off, it would've been nice to turn down the fan a bit as it was quite cold during the night.","May 20, 2019","28    Urbanica The Meridian Hotel

1604,"This boutique hotel is IG and decor goals. Affordable compared to other hotels considering it's still in the main part of SoBe, and just a short walk from the beach. The lobby cafe has a limited menu and is a tad pricey, but so is everything in Miami. Get the beef empanadas! Who would've known I'd find my favorite empanadas in the lobby of my hotel? The staff was also very friendly and accommodating, esp the front desk. I didn't get to drink at the bar, but it looked super cute. The ""chill out"" room by the pool was also clutch when I had to do a little work during my trip. My only gripes were paper thin walls. You can hear EVERYTHING. My advice if you're actually trying to get some sleep in Miami, is get a top floor room if at all possible. Or at the very least not right over the bar/lobby here you can hear the music from below. Speaking of walls, not only were they barren - they were dirty. I didn't mind the minimalistic rooms, but it would help a lot of they just repainted the walls. Lots of marks and scratches that made the place look run down. Lastly, our cleaning service wasn't consistent. Sometimes they gave us new towels, sometimes they didn't. And there were beach towels on the floor that were obviously used, but they didn't take.Regardless, I would probably stay here again.","May 8, 2019","28    Urbanica The Meridian Hotel

1607,I come to Miami once or twice a year and normally would stay at a new hotel each time. There's so many to choose from so I like checking out the variety but I always picked something directly on the ocean. My first visit here was in August 2017 and decided to give this a chance because my prior years stay at a very trendy hotel was quite disappointing (not worth the money). This wasn't beachfront but the plunge pool looked amazing and the beach was only a short walk away. Sooooo happy I chose this place and have since returned in Aug 2018. The staff are really warm and helpful. And the general manager made time to speak with me each time. I've actually never headed to the beach when I stay here because I love the pool and cabana area so much. Food and drinks are delicious and thoughtfully prepared. Not your standard burger and fries which is a plus in my book. They also have a small romantic lounge for cocktails at night. Beds are really comfortable with crisp white linens. I don't plan on staying anywhere else in Miami (except their new hotels opening down there). Part of me doesn't want the secret of this boutique hotel to get out because it's a true gem.

1610,"It;s not just because of the (two) welcome mojitos, the never-ending smiles and handshakes and complimentary this and that. It's not just because of the comfortable beds, the essential oils misting thru-out the hotel property, the peaceful rooftop swimming pool retreat and adjacent ""chill room"", the hip bikes (locks and helmets provided), the generous beach towels and beach chaise lounger service (tip the Esteban chair boys, they'll be nicer).... It's mostly becuase they freakin' CARE that you are truly 100% satisfied! My girlfriend Alicia and I were treated VIPs. We also heard the same from the equally chill and super fun guests from London, Amsterdam and Sao Paolo. Our new friends had the very same things to say. We booked a basic room facing the courtyard and, truthfull, it was too small. The front desk crew tried to offer us an upgrade (we didnt even ask) but couldn't get us upgraded for the 3 days in a row so we kept our room.

While smaller, the room did not lack for amenities. There was a small desk, enough electrical outlets, a closet and the bathroom had well thought out features. There is a common room which has comfortable seating area and a projection TV which seems like a great idea until you realize there are guests that are going to party their asses off until 3:00 am. That and the fact that our room was in front of the housekeeping closet and elevator and housekeeping was super loud while we were trying to sleep in a bit after a long trip out from the west coast. The free bike rentals were awesome and the front desk was very helpful. The cafe downstairs was great (very European once again). Great location with free beach towels.

1614,"We really enjoyed our stay at Urbanica. Clean and perfect location close to the beach and restaurants. The hotel offers free bikes and beach beds. Breakfast is very good considering the price (10$), but there could have been a better selection of greens (tomatoes, cucumber etc.), and bacon and/or ham. The service is excellent and they actually took care of our luggage one extra night when we were in Key West! ","March 24, 2019","28    Urbanica The Meridian Hotel

1622,"Very nice pool-area. Supreme location. The room was lacking adequate lighting which made reading in bed impossible and packing/unpacking too complicated. The day of arrival, during traveling, we received a mail informing us that our two rooms had been cancelled without further notice. Very frustrating of course, the staff could help us though since we reached them in time. Not entirely clear what caused this, the receptionist could not explain what had happened. At arrival the staff was also a bit hostile due to the fact of mix-ups as to which traveling party that should be accommodated in which room. This I find very surprising with two parties, one couple and one 4-member family, and two rooms; one 2-bed and one 4-bed. Didn't try the breakfast. Drinks at the bar were ok but didn't go further than that. Overall OK, would not recommend it specifically based on this stay.","March 4, 2019","28    Urbanica The Meridian Hotel

All the staff are attentive and the amenities are clean and new with comfy beds. I must say my wife and I travel around the world and meet lots of great people but we have yet to find a place like the Urbanica in Miami. Sexton and Jamison are the real reasons we come back here.

They promised me this would all be refunded when i check out but after a few long discussions and arguments i gave up and hoped this would be refunded.

The room was clean, and cleaned every day of our stay. Those are the Pro's. The Con's is this is definitely not a four star hotel. The bar inside is dingy, and the bartender is not actually a bartender (My Prosecco was served in a white wine glass, not complaining as I got double the serving size, but scratched my head a bit). The hallways had an AWFUL smell. The bathroom was TINY and dingy. No robes (which would be helpful when going to the pool). The towels were frayed. The pool is tiny, and right by the road. The hotel played loud music all day/night outside (which is fine) but if you're looking for a relaxing vibe, this ain't it.

1647,great place to stay. very close to the beach. they have an hourly shuttle to take you to the beach where they provide beach loungers but the walk to the beach is hardly 5 minutes and very scenic. unlimited bottled water and starbucks coffee was a definite perk. very nice ambiance and a lot of places to eat nearby. you can use apps to get food delivered to the hotel. comfy rooms. the pool is a little small but really nice. we had a great time chilling by the pool. David at the reception was really great. we had requested for two rooms close-by but it wasn't available. so david gave us an upgrade for both the rooms so the family could be right next to each other. he also arranged for transportation back to the airport at a very reasonable price. he promptly arranged for everything we wanted and gave us tips to go around as well. security and clealiness was really great. there was a sand play area for the children and badminton and table tennis playing areas for the adults as well. the parking or the lack of thereof was a total bummer. there is no parking facility at the property and the valet parking is exorbitant at $40 a night. free parking areas so close to the beach are not available. Luckily david guided us to a public parking building behind the police station close to the hotel (7-8 minute walk). it cost about $12-15 per car for about 8-10 hours which was way cheaper than the valet. it would have been nice if the swimming pool had been bigger as it did get slightly crowded at peak hours but that wasn't really a big bummer as you always have the option of switching between the beach or the pool anytime you want due to the convenient location.,"June 14, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

1652,"Positives: -the very convenient location...stores, restaurants and cvs across the street, the beach 5 min walk away -the staff...very nice and professional -the facilities like table tennis, badminton, free rental bikes... my adolescent kids had lots of fun playing while I relaxed in the hammock watching them!! We went to southmost pointe park pier with the rental bikes, too, all the way taking the boardwalk. It was so fun and was a great experience for a mother and a daughter together! (Attention! They rent the bikes only to 14 yrs old and up because of the law! Although we wanted to do it a whole family together, my younger daughter stayed in the pool with my husband while my other daughter and I went off for a cycling)-complimentary breakfast in the garden was nice!Negatives:-we left the room at 8 am and came back at about 4 pm expecting the room already done, but it was as we left in the morning. Later they came by but we were already taking a rest in the room, so we just got the towels changed. One of the things I like about a hotel stay is that when I come back after having had a full day outside, I find the room clean and neat, so this time it was a little disappointing for me. Their towels always smelled strange too.-inside the pool there was a group of young adults playing with a ball and making lots of fuss. Literally they had the whole pool just for themselves, making the other guests very uncomfortable. My daughters couldn’t even step in. I think the staff could take a little control over the situation.-our window faced was with the corridor, and we had our blind always down for our privacy. I think this is an open air kind hotel good for young people. After this hotel we stayed in a more elegant and classy kind hotel in mid beach, and while my husband and I preferred the second one, our daughters liked better this hotel. Overall I enjoyed myself in this place, too! ","May 29, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

1656,"SERVICE:Service wasn't too bad. The concierge was really nice and greeted us with fantastic welcome drinks. When we checked in on the afternoon of May 8, the woman at the front desk looked like she didn't want to be there, but indifferent customer service doesn't really bother me. When we checked out on the morning of May 13, however, the woman at the front desk was so sweet and friendly! I wish I was able to remember her name so I could let her boss know that she's great. LOCATION:When I was researching accommodations in South Beach, it was WPH's location that sold me. This isn't the most luxurious hotel, but the cost per night wasn't too exorbitant and it's only two blocks away from the beach and some of the nightlife on Ocean Drive. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance as well. PROPERTY AMENITIES: I loved the amenities of this place! The pool was beautiful and relaxing, but my favorite part was the grass area. It had a hammock, some lawn games and lawn furniture, and despite being on a main street, we still had a lot of peace and privacy. Grabbing a bunch of drinks and snacks with friends and taking them down to this grassy area was probably the highlight of my stay at WPH.THE ROOM:We stayed in the Premium Room with Two Queen Beds, which fit five people perfectly! There was a lot of space in the bathroom and the room itself, but, unfortunately, here comes the part that explains why I couldn't give WPH five stars: The sofa bed and the bathroom. The sofa bed was awful. The mattress was probably 6"" thick at best and it felt like we were laying on a bag of springs. The bathroom, however, was the worst part. I took a shower in flip flops because I was so grossed out by the mold in the crevices and corners of the shower. OVERALL:If you're looking for a hotel with great amenities, reasonable prices (by South Beach standards) and a great location, I absolutely recommend staying here. If you're looking for something a little more high-end, this may not be the place.","May 19, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

1659,"I stayed here from 30th April until 4th May and celebrated my birthday whilst there.We got an early flight from New York and, despite arriving there before noon, the room was ready for us when we checked in, amazing. The ladies on reception were very friendly and everyone gets a welcome drink. They actually upgraded me from a room with two double beds to two Kings. I thought this was a really nice gesture and then, when we were unpacking in the room a short while later, there was a knock on the door; it was one of the ladies from reception with a bottle of fizz in an ice bucket and some birthday balloons, how sweet! I never get that on birthdays in European hotels!The room was spacious and clean with a small fridge which was re-stocked with free water most days, a free safe, coffee making facilities, hair dryer and good storage with some hanging space. My saving grace were the USB points for charging my phone after I had forgotten my plug adaptor!There are approximately 3 different blocks, with Reception in the first, we stayed in Bel Aire, which is where the gym is, not that I went in it!There is an outdoor pool and a separate games area with more sunbeds. The pool is considerably smaller than it looks in photos, but there is also the beach really close by, on Ocean Drive. The hotel has a tuk tuk to take you there each hour if you need it. You can get beach towels from reception, as well as unlimited ice pops and small bottles of water.Games were table tennis, giant Jenga and Connect 4 and there was a yoga class there the first afternoon we sat there. At the beach, if you go to the designated area for the hotel (information provided upon check-in) and give your details to the girl in the cabin, you can get towels and a bed. The first day we went to the beach there was a parasol, but the second day they wanted us to pay $20 for it. Normally beds are $20 each with an added $20 per parasol, so it pays to go to the right area!Location wise it was great, there is a diner across the road for convenient breakfasts, Ocean Drive is a 5 minute walk and has lots of options for lunch, cocktails, evening plans etc. Also, go to Española Way for a nice area to eat, good variety of restaurants in a pedestrianised side street with cute fairy lights.Juan Carlos was the Concierge and helped me arrange a car to the airport for my flight to London. He was super helpful and friendly, so shout out to JC! He also recommended to me the bakery up the road, where you can get croissants and baguettes, the lovely lady in there will make them fresh for you if nothing on display takes your fancy. Cross the road in front of the diner and walk right, it’s a couple of doors up. Tip, if you go to Little Havana, stop for a drink and a nibble in the Ball and Chain, good cocktails, lovely food and I think we went on a Wednesday where women drink for free between 8 and 10!Overall, I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again if I ever find myself in Miami.","May 15, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

1668,"We stayed at Washington Park Hotel for 2 nights in March on our way from Orlando down to The Keys. It was a delightful break in our journey, and a great hotel.The proximity to Ocean Drive was great; only 4 blocks away and a complementary cart available if needed. The hotel is made up of several art deco buildings, with a great pool and garden full of outdoor games to the front. Plenty to keep our two year old entertained during the stay. And very Instagrammable too.It was incredibly hot when we were there, so the staff served complementary ice pops regularly around the pool each day. This was a nice touch to keep everyone cool (and hydrated!)The downsides were the parking, although this is a problem for most hotels in South Beach. The public car park next door would have been ideal, but was full for most of our stay. And also the noise from the rooms above and to the side in the lower floors of 'Kenmore' - the main building. We moved to a suite on the top floor for our second night which was much quieter. The staff were very apologetic, and quickly switched the rooms. We'd highly recommend requesting this type of room.Overall, we'd definitely recommend Washington Park Hotel.","May 4, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

1669,"This is most likely the dirtiest hotel we've stayed in since we were kids and were far from that now. The pictures beat no resemblance to what the room actually looks like. It's filthy: floors in the bedroom are so dirty that after waking around barefooted got an hour our feet were black. We asked to have them mopped at the desk but never happened. The bathroom floor was disgusting, tiny little wastebaskets with no liners. So gross. The hallways have some kind of felt rugs that were stained and never get vacuumed. The floors are buckling in places and even the doors to the rooms are dirty. You have to ask for bath tissue and fresh towels. Poolside towel chair covers don't get charged so you'd better bring a towel down to sit on. There is no dresser in bedroom or even a hook in the bathroom to hang wet towels. Walls are so thin that we were kept up 2 nights from people walking around during the night, people fighting in the hall for 2 nights. Advice? Don't do it. I've had cleaner tents.

1674,"The hotel is in a great location. You can walk to just about everything that Sout Beach has to offer which isnt that much. Its a beach party town and not much else. That was fine for us as just staying for a few days before heading on cruise.We booked through British Airways and the pics on their site do not resemble the room we got and that was even after paying for an upgrade. We ended up in a basic motel style room. It was comfortable enough but looked a bit tired. I can only compare it to a Travelodge which we have in UK. Basic, clean with no bells and whistles. Only difference is that this would cost you £50 in UK and not £250 as this room cost. Hotel pool was small but nice and we always got a bed. The hotel has free beds at the beach and we used them as well which was nice.Every member of staff we met were very nice and helpful. This was a great base for our trip but for the price paid, expected more but I get the impression that this may have even been a bargain for the location we were in.","April 29, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

It is only 2 blocks away from Ocean Drive and the beach so one can just walk back and forth. They provide long chairs on the beach by the way. While being close to Ocean Drive and in the middle of the Art Deco district, it is very quiet. No issue to sleep at night. The rooms are very large. They provide bottles of water unlimited for free. Why i did not give it 5 marks? If you book several rooms, they dont book them next to each other at the time of the booking and do their best on arrival date. If i did not make a fuss, we would have been on different floors and the lady was not happy with me for reminding her of my initial disappointment. Secondly, the breakfast is quite limited and average at best. They dont have tea for example (How can one not have hot water and tea bags???) and they use tons of platic (plates, glasses, cutlery, etc..). Finally the pool is nice but small.Having said all of the above, i still recommend the hotel as a nice choice thanks to its location.","April 22, 2019","29    Washington Park Hotel South Beach

1695,All I have to say is that when you're going to South Beach Miami....you have to check out The Shore Club. Man oh man wifey and I were impressed with the place and the staff. The hospitality that we had encountered was priceless.I have to give Vachira (Personal VIP Concierge) and her staff lots of praise for making our stay every so pleasant. I told their Reservation Desk that this is our first time in Miami and this is on our Anniversary. So of course they had chilled champagne and chocolate coated strawberries waiting in the room for us. They had upgraded our room to a Suite with a balcony with the Oceanfront view. I mean c'mon...you can't do better than that! The housekeeping staff was very friendly and the whole place was very clean. Even though there are other hotels nearby...when we go back to South Beach....we're going back to The Shore Club!!,"July 5, 2019","30    Shore Club South Beach

1699,"Stayed at The Shore Club for my best friend’s bachelorette. Ten young, fine ladies in total. I personally stayed in one of the poolside, duplex bungalows thinking that it was going to be an elegant experience. Well hunny, I was wrong!! I understand science and all, specifically the fact that heat rises— but so did my blood pressure when I found myself in bed, on the second floor, tossing and turning, desperate for some cool air to assist in my relaxation mode via vacation. Even with the “central air” on 65 degrees at all times, the second floor was musty and muggy. One of my roommates during this stay, who was particularly whiny, found herself wailing in despair regarding the fact that she had to be up at 5 am for a flight home and could not sleep due to the music that was blasting at the bar (mind you, there wasn’t a peasant in sight enjoying this music). Some of the outlets didn’t work on the ground floor, we were constantly accompanied by mosquitos, and I practically lost my arm closing the sliding glass door every time I entered the bungalow (mind you, I’m a petite, scrawny individual, so this was a workout for me every time !!) All and all, next time I come to Miami Beach, I will be staying at The Setai on Collins Ave. Hopefully I marry rich, because the way things are going, I HAVE TO PAY !!!!!!

As soon as I checked into the Shore Club I bolted to my room to change and head out onto the beach. (The weather has been abysmal the past few days) wow what a sight! Colorful umbrellas everywhere and the beach was nearly spotless. I’ve heard of the effort to clean South Beach but this was insane. Not one cigarette butt in sight. I was firstly greeted by Jason. He informed me that his team and him would take great care of me and that’s exactly what they did. Jason introduced me to Cesar, which greeted me with a stern handshake and smile. We chatted for a few about where I’m from and why I chose to stay here. After Cesar escorted me to my chair and set me up. I truly thanked him and relaxed for the rest of the afternoon.

1703,"The good stuff...great location, ok pool, and great beach. Service...the young man at check in seemed challenged. Communication is not one of his skills. The rooms...The mattress was lumpy on both beds and sunk down in the middle, no hair dryer, the floor is concrete and is partially covered with 2 rugs that overlap and are sold at Home Depot. The rugs were very dirty. The chairs on the balcony are horribly uncomfortable. Metal chairs from Target? Neither housekeeping or the front desk answer phones and I tried repeatedly. The desk chair is ripped on the bottom of the legs. There are holes in the black out curtains so light filters into the room in the morning. The shears are filthy. I finally got the maid to ask for a blow dryer...it came an hour later. The shower...oh my. It has a shower head that clearly is meant to save water because it has no power. Took forever to wash and rinse my hair. Tiny TV. The bed frames are painted metal and are scratched. All in all this property, if inspected by AAA would rate 1 star. I'm afraid it is a dump riding on it's past glory days.. It is sad that this grand old property is in this condition. Not worth 300.00 a night!

1704,"Just returned from a week long break with my wife at the stunning Shore Club on Collins and it was magnificent. Having stayed in the area for years during business travel, I’d only ever looked on at the Shore Club as one of the original quintessentially cool South Beach venues so to have the opportunity to stay there with my wife and celebrate in our 20th married year was just fantastic.Mixed with some work and meetings too, the Shore Club provided us with the perfect home for the week, and the scent when you walk in to the lobby, combined with the beautiful candles and smiles just made everything that much more welcoming.Even before we arrived, the concierge - Vachira - gave us some phenomenal tips for places to eat, drink, party and enjoy South Beach (the tips were great, by the way!). On arrival at the hotel, the staff were so very welcoming, polite and genuinely pleased to have us there. Vachira had so kindly arranged for a stunning room for us too, so we landed up on the 19th floor with spectacular views of the beach and the ocean.The room itself was a King Ocean View room and was charming. Cool stone floors with seagrass matting, large ocean facing king bed with crisp white linen and decor. The bathroom was large, bright and clean and the shower would have fit about 17 people if we’d have tried…. Waking up and seeing the view of the ocean and hearing the waves was truly incredible.The restaurant Diez y Seiz is fabulous. They serve tapas style dishes which are incredibly tasty and great to share. Service is great too. This is also the restaurant where breakfast is served - either from the buffet (which, albeit limited, is delightful) or a-la-carte (we didn’t try this as we had the buffet included in our rate)Going down to the beach, the staff were amazing and couldn’t be more helpful or personable. The entire team down there genuinely want to help you to have a great time. The sun beds are very comfortable and enough space in between for your personal space not to be compromised BUT one thing that was pretty annoying was that the cabana style beds completely blocked the views as soon as the wind breaks were put up. If the cabanas were moved forwards towards the shore by 10 feet it would resolve this. The refreshments at the beach were all brought to the bed by super helpful and friendly girls and guys, again who couldn’t do enough to please.The courtyard bar in the evening has a really great ambience and the music is pretty cool too. Either table (loungers) service or you can go to the bar, and the drinks menu is great too (the margaritas are awesome, and the rum based drinks are immense).The gym is small but perfectly formed and pretty well equipped for a hotel gym. Couple of treadmills, couple of bikes, couple of steps & elypticals, then a free weight area and a separate room with resistance / weight machines. Pretty impressive and something to help keep that Miami Beach body in check after a bucket of margaritas the night before….The pool parties are pretty cool, awesome atmosphere and very good music. The DJs we heard playing pulled together some great sets which were akin to more European style pool parties - the good ones, not the ones with Euro techno! - where the tracks were all vocal, soulful and recognisable. The sets are for around 4 hours too so, as a DJ myself, I had admiration for the guys for keeping the atmosphere growing throughout.In all, an absolutely fabulous break. Thank you Shore Club, we can’t wait to return. ","June 18, 2019","30    Shore Club South Beach

1706,"I stayed here for Labor Day weekend and booked it through booking.com. My CC on file got charged the first night so I had a balance of 530 dollars left to settle at the hotel. On check in day, they put an authorization hold of 530+ 300(for incidentals) on my credit card= total of 830. During out check out, we settled my remaining balance of 530 using my bf’s CC as final payment. What I don’t understand is why they had to ask for me to pay again during check out when there is already a hold on my account at check in and you can just collect those funds. Until now (June 13), there is still a 830 dollar hold on my CC after we paid for everything at the hotel using a different card. I called today and the reservation guy could not seem to figure out why I still have a hold on CC on file. He even blamed booking.com for charging but the charges were made at the hotel since I swiped my card there before the amount came up. I was told that “accounting” will have to take a deeper look at it and will get back to me in 7-10 days. I am annoyed that it is taking this long for them to remove the hold since I want to use those funds to earn miles/points for upcoming trips. I suggest booking with another hotel if you want to avoid this type of complication.","June 13, 2019","30    Shore Club South Beach

The balcony floor was covered in bird muck and our balcony furniture consisted of 2 rusty and unsafe looking chairs (no table). The carpet was threadbare (as was most of the carpet in the hotel). The room smelt musty and the shower cubicle had not been cleaned. I went straight to reception and complained about everything I had seen thus far. The receptionist (upgraded) gave me a room on the 10th floor, good view, bigger room, nicer furniture in the room and balcony, but it all appeared very dated and in need of a good clean and freshening up.

However, several disappointments: small rooms and not very practical, as there are not enough outlets nor space to hang out towels in the bathroom. Pool was always crowded and even though we went very early to the beach to reserve good front spots, additional rows of chairs kept being added so we needed behind people that showed up later in the day. Also, the beach service is separate from hotel, resort fee only covers chairs and towels, umbrellas are extra.

1741,"We are less than impressed with Shore Club. FACILITIES: The room has a concrete, minimalist motif that is clean. They forgot to make it convenient, though. Only one wall has outlets; no outlets near the bed, no outlets near the mirror in the room, etc. The coffeemaker comes with two metal packets of coffee and some powdered sweetners and non-dairy powder whitener--no way to make tea. The bathroom has some recessed lights over the tub and lights on the sides of a mirror behind a large sink that prevents closeup viewing. There is no shaving mirror. There is no line for drying bathing suits. POOL/BEACH: We were never able to take advantage of the pool or the beach due to overcrowding and ""out of towels."" Obviously, the hotel is overbuilt with too many rooms to accommodate all guests in beach or pool. We talked with other guests who had the same issue.STAFF: The cleaning crew is clanging and banging in the hallway essentially all day--beginning early in the morning even on Saturday. Much of the time, they are not cleaning but are standing in the hallway loudly chatting with each other. Noise from the hall echoes into the concrete rooms. AMENITIES: The room comes with 2 bottles of water per day--kid-sized bottles. It comes with two beach chairs--but guests are required to pay $22 for the beach umbrella. And, it is the first time in years that I have wished I brought my own shampoo and conditioner. It's there, but shampoo is thin and conditioner seemed ineffective. RESTAURANT: A light lunch at the outside restaurant was delicious and beautifully prepared, although pricier than we are accustomed to paying for similar foods. I would recommend the restaurant if you are staying in the hotel. I would recommend the hotel only if you are young, enjoy loud music, and like crowded pools and beaches.","April 13, 2019","30    Shore Club South Beach

Rooms are clean, they give free water bottles, they have beach access and a nice pool. However their service at the bar, beach, and restaurant are soooo slow its unbelievable. I've stayed here about 4x the past 7mos with hopes it would improve but it seems to get worse. There is only one man at the pool who always remembers me and my colleagues so he is the exception, however he is overworked. I was also upset about the pool when we asked for the bed area they said we had to spend at least $100 pp, which is totally fine, and we did.

1749,"My wife and I had a three night stay at the Setai. I have stayed at some of the nicest hotels in the world and several in Miami Beach. The rooms are quite good as is the service. However, when it comes to smoking, they allow it in the pool areas; it’s simply toxic. The first day I didn’t care and chalked it up to uninformed Europeans. Today, however, there is rigorous cigar smoking with the stuff going everywhere. There are children, pregnant women, and people (semi smart ones at least) who don’t want to breathe in carcinogens. How this policy can be allowed when it is known what consequences second hand smoke can have is beyond me. It’s foolish at best and negligent at worst. I will not stay at this hotel again and will inform my colleagues not to stay here until this archaic policy is changed with an injection of common sense.","June 23, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1756,"... in the center of everything worth visiting in Miami Beach. Greeting was friendly and sincere. The staff was attentive from the doormen and parking attendants to the housekeepers and porters and everyone in between. Our room was clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. We rested and slept in a quiet peaceful room. The bathrooms were large, attractive and functional. This is a quiet upscale hotel and not loud and obnoxious like some other hotels with similar food rankings. The pools are wonderful and different water temperatures, the warmest being the apparent favorite of the families with younger children. We sat by the coolest pool which was excellent for swimming and cooling off. Pool service was professional and friendly. Drinks and food selection was good.The mix of young families and older couples made this resort more attractive. In spite of the busy season, finding a place to lounge at the pool or beach was relatively easy. The boutique retail shops were independently operated and offered exceptional quality and selection for women and men.Dining options are good and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Great coffee. Lobby bar was attractive, comfortable and offered the restaurant as well as their own limited late dining menu. Beach-front grill restaurant was very good. From servers to busers, everyone said hello, expressed their desire to assist, and made us feel welcome and appreciated. Room service selection was good. The outdoor lounge and indoor gym were wonderful, comfortable and well maintained. The Setai is an exceptionally outstanding hotel - it has earned the five stars and management and staff alike don’t appear to take their great standing for granted. At The Setai, you get what you pay for without the hype and the noise some of the trendy hotels make you put up with. I’ll be back sooner then later.","March 19, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1759,"We reserved The Setai for a 5-night family getaway looking for an upscale experience while being close to all the activity of South Beach. And to a large extent, we got what we wanted. I say to a large extent because The Setai is of course located close to the action and no one can deny it is a higher tier establishment. However, some parts of the experience did not match what we have seen at other 5-star properties. Explanation. The Setai is indeed a high end hotel from the perspective of service. In fact, we think that’s where it shines. While we did meet the odd less courteous employee as you do anywhere, the vast majority went out of their way to please and assist us. Included in there was the front desk (manager, I believe) who sought us out at the restaurant to enquire about a request of ours or a call from more pillows that came within mere minutes of the ask or the waiter at our first breakfast who was so welcoming. Really, excellent service overall.We also enjoyed the inclusions that come with the Ocean Suite we had reserved: Free airport pickup/drop off, generous buffet breakfast, short distance limo service, non alcoholic beverages included in the suite.The hotel is also quite pleasing from a design standpoint, especially the lobby on Collins, the courtyard and the 3 pools. All refined and inviting.Where we thought The Setai fell short of other 5-stars is on 3 points. First, room amenities. While our 2-bedroom city/ocean view suite was spacious and offered amazing vistas, we thought the bedding was average for a hotel of this class. A rather firm mattress with no flat sheet, just a duvet. And even though the room description specified a king bed, it really felt like a queen. In a hotel of this class, we would have expected more of an elaborate bed setup. The living room also only featured one sofa/day bed and none of the other furniture (two single chairs and a backless sofa) we saw in the photos.Second, the decor. We highlighted how we liked the the lobby on Collins as well as the courtyard and the 3 pools. However, in other areas, we didn’t feel it worked as well. The lobby of the tower where the most expensive units are felt underwhelming. You’d expect something a bit grander when making your way to a room that’s worth a couple thousands a night. It’s not bad looking just maybe a tad too subdued and cramped. And other parts are not aging well like the corridors which would need some sprucing up in the not too distant future IMO. Finally, you’d expect more high end materials in some areas like the bathrooms and what appears to be black-glazed ciment tiles.Thirdly, peace and quiet. Being in South Beach, you should expect more noise than in some of the quieter communities up the coast. We indeed heard some late night party noise from neighboring properties but nothing dramatic. We did hear however the huge ventilation shaft from the Shore Club next door on our balcony and even indoor, and we were on the 38th floor of the tower. Deal breaker, no, but if you are looking to hear the quiet sounds of the ocean, you likely won’t get it, at least on the south side of the building. So all in all, The Setai is a very good option in South Beach. Would we recommend it? Yes, as long as you expect some of the shortcomings versus other high end establishments.","March 10, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

We liked the fact it was included in our rate as we have stayed elsewhere in Miami and the breakfast can be very expensive. Room very nice with comfy bed and good pillows. Lunch by the pool lots of choice and we have always got a table quickly. 3 pools with different temperatures, the warm one was divine as warm as a bath! Dinner at the hotel twice with an Asian vibe was very good. Loads of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and shopping just a 15 minute walk away. No issue getting sunbeds which are very comfy. And no extra charges for beds and umbrellas as some hotels do in Miami Bottled water free of charge as is fruit. Nice touches which can be expensive if having to buy each time. Gym good one niggle if you read this management we had to ask everyday to make the air con cooler as its set at 75! Staff here are super friendly and nothing too much trouble. We also liked the fact its really chilled here and quiet with no loud music around the pool as we are here during spring break.

1762,"First of all I want to say we absolutely loved the Setai, we have been there at least 5 or 6 times and really loved everything about the hotel. The personal service, the feeling etc... but this time we left with a very bad feeling and I’m not sure if we are going back. We really love the style of the hotel it has a very peaceful surrounding and although rooms are maybe a little bit outdated it didn’t really bothered me. The pools and beach are very beautiful also the service at the pools is very good. The food at the pool restaurant is ok but not high quality for the price they are asking (same for the cocktails) we were 3 adults and for sure every lunch would cost us around 200$. The food in yaya is horrible! And also extremely expensive.The breakfast is good. I never did a massage because they charge you easily 400$ for a massage. Some of the staff have been there for years and are really lovely people who give you a very warm feeling. But one girl at the front desk just ignored me my entire stay?!?! I passed her every day and she didn’t even looked up from her computer to say good morning?! We were travelling with our 2 kids 1 and 4 year old, there is nothing extra in the hotel for kids. They don’t do anything to make them feel at home. No kids club, no toys at the pool, nothing extra in the room... all the hotels next door have toys on the beach with little chairs and a sand castle or something. Also the hotel is completely different during the week or weekend. They have people that are there every week from the apartments so they know the staff and then you will be ignored completely. As we were travelling with our 2 kids and had a late flight back to Europe we requested a late check out directly to the manager (we even offered to pay for this) we had 2 rooms as my mom also joined us. The manager said we could have the room from my mother until 4pm and we had to give our room back the sooner the better. I asked him if we really couldn’t pay something extra as our driver only came to pick us up around 9pm and I didn’t want to keep my kids and myself entertained in the hotel lobby for 5 hours before flying to Europe. We even wanted to pay an extra night but he said the hotel was fully booked. Which I could understand but then at 12 I go and check out my room and the guy at the front desk offers me a late check out until 4 because my room is not taken?!!?!! So I ask him if I pay extra I can keep it longer then 4? He asks something to the girl who by the way ignored me the whole week and she answers the manager said no?! Ok I told him never mind because he was obviously feeling bad he just proposed me a late check out. Later in the afternoon I go to my moms room because the baby needs a nap. I ordered a baby bed in that room it was not there so I called back to housekeeping asking where the baby bed is. After that the front desk called me back and asked why I needed a baby bed and if I want to extend my stay?!?!! I asked them if it was possible and the say yes!! After spending 9 nights and over 25 000$ in a hotel you DON’T want to be treated that way!!! We all showered in the spa area and didn’t bothered anymore. But this for sure wasn’t a good end to my holiday. For this amount of money I find a much nicer holiday and hopefully the girl at the front desk doesn’t ignore me!

If I may have been somewhat unresponsive, pardon. I appreciate those staff who helped me.The next day, I was greeted by the beautiful morning sunshine. That day was great. I enjoyed my sumptious breakfast and headed to the beach. Perfect morning for my very long hours of sleep.This hotel's asset are their employees. Thank you and hopefully, see you soon.#GentWander","February 17, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1765,"The service at the Setai is impeccable. I stayed for 4 nights with my husband and 6 month old. We were picked up at the airport from the Setai car and the driver was more than lovely and made it very seamless for us being that we had the baby. We were able to get into our room at 10 am which is pretty unheard of in South Beach. The Setai provided our room with a crib for the baby and a baby care package that I found so thoughtful. We dined in room one night and it was the best fried rice I have ever had! We also had breakfast in the courtyard everyday. The food selection at breakfast is incomparable to anywhere else I have been and if they happen to not have something you are looking for, I am sure they would accomodate you. The coconuts pool side are also something not to shy away from. We enjoyed lunch by the pool everyday and I happened to order the fish tacos every time because they were so delicious and light. The pool service couldn’t be better, the waiter knew our names by the end of Day 1 and even greeted us upon passing when we weren’t at the pool. The Setai will always be our first choice when staying on South Beach.","February 13, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1767,"It has been our great luck to have discovered the Setai Hotel in Miami Beach. Here at the Setai we have enjoyed one of the best hotel experiences in our many years of travel all over the globe. We visited in January 2019 and had mixed weather, some sun, some overcast days with rain, and strong winds but nothing stopped us from truly relaxing at this great hotel. From our very first impression at the Front Desk until of departure five days later every aspect of our visit was a delightful experience and absolutely faultless. The hotel staff operate as smoothly as a Swiss watch, discrete and efficient. The room we stayed in was an Art Deco suite, beautifully appointed, extremely comfortable and quiet. The morning buffet breakfasts are outstanding, the display is very attractive and the food is very fresh and tasty. All the breads are baked fresh in the kitchen. The swimming pools and beach facilities are well designed and away from all the ruckus that normally typifies the South Beach area. The hotel is located in the heart of South Beach and close to great walking areas and good restaurants and shopping. The wonderful staff at the Setai are very professional and gracious and our time with the Concierge, the housekeepers, the bell staff, the valets, the wait staff, even the chefs was charming. Everyone went out of their way to make sure our experience was warm and gracious. The outstanding hospitality exhibited by all the members of the Setai team is very tangible and remarkable. The hotel sets a high standard for service that will be hard to replicate any where else. We look forward to returning as soon as possible. 6 stars out of 5 for the Setai.","February 8, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1769,"I spent 8 days at the Setai, some for work and then stayed over the weekend for fun. of the 189 nights I slept in luxury hotels this past year The Setai is one of the best. I was not in the new tower I was in the older rooms with no view. However, the room is massive, with sitting areas galore and the tub in the bedroom saw LOTS of use. It was really divine. I didn't have a good view but that meant I had to spend more time at the pool and beach! The pool is a bit too shady for my taste with so may trees but perhaps it is better when it is hotter (was only in the 70's during my stay). The beach was great with super comfy chairs and quick food and beverage service. The sandwich on the beach menu is really good.Service wise The Setai was amazing. They are 5* and they deserve it. The staff take PRIDE in treating everyone as unique and special guests. The back bar by the pool lacks top notch service compared to the rest, so not sure what happened there but nothing that takes away from the experience. They have three smaller pools each with a different temperature which is very nice.Location is great - easy walk to any of the hot spots. I loved the bar but recommend walking next door to the W Bar too - its even cooler. Of course there is no shortage of great bars in SB so - enjoy!","January 4, 2019","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1771,"From the moment we arrived, we knew this would be an experience unlike any other in Miami Beach. We were greeted warmly with a beautiful glass of signature iced tea, and a cool hand towel with which to refresh ourselves. We had booked our stay through a travel reward program and originally opted for a city view room. We didn’t plan to be in the hotel much. That ALL changed after we were offered an upgrade to a stunning Oceanview suite with a balcony and separate study. From our warm welcome, to our suite tour, we knew that excellent service was their priority. Nightly turndown service provided us with champagne chocolates and custom slippers at bedside. We had planned to visit a local restaurant for dinner but were encouraged to stay in and visit the Asian Night Market. Dinner was above average and the house DJ gave it a fabulous energy. We were seated with a fabulous view of the fire dancer and her whirling flame filled headpiece. Our weekend was spent beach and poolside. With three pools of varying temps, there is a comfortable space for you to relax and be served. Lunch poolside was delicious and photo worthy. This hotel certainly offers plenty of IG worthy photo ops. The text messages from our host throughout the weekend ensured our every need was met in a timely manner. Honestly, there were times we felt a bit out of place because of all of the attention. When does that ever happen? Apparently at The Setai, it’s EVERY SINGLE DAY. Whether you are looking for a quiet getaway or a trip with friends, if elegance, service, and privacy, is important, I would suggest The Setai as a first choice!!","December 7, 2018","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

There are three pools. Three different temperatures. One for families. Pools are beautiful. Wonderful service. The grill restaurant at the pool had a terrific menu. The gym was great. They opened it for me before official opening. Housekeeping was thoughtful. Put Velcro wrappers on charger cords. Left lens cleaner for glasses. It’s those small touches. Everyone we came into contact with was polite and seemed to want us to be enjoying ourselves. Not fawning. Just right.

We used these several times to get around Miami Beach. The location is fantastic. In the heart of Miami Beach, right on the beach, close to all key attractions.

Located right on the South Beach sea front makes it easy to access the beach and whether it is to venture into the sun or simply sit back and sunbathe The Setai make sure you are well cared for. The hotels private beach makes it very convenient for guests. The food service even at the beach is quick and courteous. The rooms are comfortably large and well appointed. The Courtyard is an open outdoor dining space that surrounds a water body. this is a very relaxing restaurant to sit back and have a relaxed meal. Being a restaurant serving Asian cuisine was an added bonus and we had some delicious Indian meals at the Courtyard. The hotel offers two large pools that are generally quite busy all through the day and attached to the pool is a dining outlet that offers a lovely view of the beach and sea front. The breakfast buffet is extensive and here too the service is exemplary. The hotels Spa too is worth a visit.Altogether a very welcoming luxury hotel.,"August 31, 2018","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

We stayed in a one room flat in the tower with outstanding views of the beach and the city - a huge balcony and beautifully fitted out. Room service was excellent on time great quality. Room cleanliness was perfect everyday. But really the whole ambience is amazing. The pool team was spot on everyday remembering our bed choice and drinks. Everyone smiled and said hello and remembered us after a few days. The pool restaurant was phenomenal with cases of Whispering Angel cold and ready. Sitting at the high table with a drink and wonderful food watching South Beach go by was magical. There are even three pools at different temperatures. Just showing the attention to detail at the pool bar a small lizard was trapped in a lamp - we pointed it out and immediately they called maintenace opened the lamp and saved the lizard!

1796,"The non-descript hotel front belies the luxury that lies within this beachfront resort. The Zen/Asian-themed decor of the hotel has a rich, dark, understated elegant feel that while not very ""beachy,"" feels wonderful nonetheless. The most luxurious of all the facets of this fabulous resort is it's staff. Everyone that we encountered during our stay, everyone, was friendly and genuinely concerned with our comfort during our stay. The room was spacious and beautifully appointed with a huge bathroom with Asprey bath products and great shower head. Our room didn't have much of a view and beside that, the only negative of our courtyard view was that in April on Friday nights the hotel holds an Asian food style bazaar ($55-65/person) with fire dancer and contortionist all accompanied by very loud music that was pounding through the closed window until 11:30pm. Since we had told them that we were celebrating my daughter's 16th birthday, they left champagne and non-alcoholic champagne bottles chilling in a wine bucket and beautiful petit fours on a platter laid out for our arrival. So sweet! The pool area is expertly run by a pool Maitre'd and very hardworking and personable pool valets (kudos to Vitaly who always checked on us!) that whisk you to your preferred spot at the pool (same set-up at the beach) onto comfortable multi-person chaise beds and wide chaise lounges. The 3 pools are each kept at different temperatures and there are plenty of sunny spaces as well as shady areas and umbrellas. We found the food and drink service to be fairly speedy at both pool and beach; there was chair service. Every time we got seated at the pool or beach, the valet delivered a tray with chilled water bottles and spray bottles of mineral water. This is a luxury resort so beware, the food and drink are not cheap but the breakfast was very good (we didn't do the buffet) and they add a 20% tip to each check. Concierge was very friendly and helpful. The spa was divine. Treatments were great and the therapists were some of the best we've every experienced at other top spas. Try the hot stone massage with Alina; still dreaming of that blissful hour! We will definitely return.","April 18, 2018","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1798,We are staying at the Setai in Miami at the moment.Booked it through our American Express concierge.We have been travelling for the last 3 weeks across South America and America and this property out of all them just does not deserve to be a five star.The rooms just do not look like anything on the pictures.Linen quality towels all very standard finish.The under bed throw falling apart.Shower designed so bad that every time you have a shower the water comes out making it a very unpleasant experience.The main washrooms in the lobby blocked.The beach which ofcourse is a shared one is constantly got noises from some work going on.Not a pleasant experience specially after staying at the Belmont Rio.Belmont igassu falls.Four seasons buonos Aires and mandarin Oriental Atlanta.This is truly not an icing on the cake.,"April 11, 2018","31    The Setai, Miami Beach

1799,"Believe me, this trip had us scouring through Miami hotels to move to as we were disappointed with the service where we are. There was no available accommodation despite turning up in several hotels, no room at the inn! We had started our search at the Setai as it was where we had stayed last visit and it was faultless. Sadly no rooms but we had a delightful late lunch with a cocktail and it was gorgeous. A true oasis in the madness that is Miami Beach this week","April 7, 2018","31    The Setai, Miami Beach
